<h1 id="ziti-identities">Ziti Identities</h1>

<p>Ziti is built on the foundation of zero-trust. A solid pillar of that foundation requires that all connections in a
Ziti-enabled network are authenticated.  Identities are the basis for Ziti authentication.  All devices connecting to a
Ziti network will have an Identity which is presented at the time of a connection being established by both the device
initiating the connection and the device receiving the incoming connection. Ziti implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication">mutual
TLS</a> in order to authenticate both sides of a connection.</p>
<p>Conceptually an identity can be thought of as congruent to a user account.  Identities are logical entities stored
inside the Ziti Controller which map an X509 certifcate to a particular named identity.  Identities exist not only to
authenticate connections but are also used to authorize identities within Ziti. See <a href="../appwans/overview.html">AppWANs</a>
for more information on authoriziation of identities.</p>
<h2 id="3rd-party-certificates">3rd Party Certificates</h2>
<p>The certificate a Ziti Edge client presents can be generated by the Ziti Controller using the configured PKI or this
certificate can come from a existing PKI not controlled by the Ziti Controller. Certificates which are not created by
the Ziti Controller are referred to as &quot;3rd Party&quot; because from the perspective of the Ziti Controller the certificates
are not from the configured PKI.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-identity">Creating an Identity</h2>
<p>The mechanism for creating identities is influenced by how your Ziti network is setup, specifically how the PKI is
established. Identities are itegrally linked to the PKI configured in a given Ziti network and directly affects how
identites are created. There are generally three groups of identities which can be created:</p>
<ul>
<li>One Time Token (ott) identites using the configured PKI</li>
<li>One Time Token (ott) identites using a 3rd Party CA</li>
<li>3rd Party auto-enrolled identities</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-an-identity-type">Choosing an Identity Type</h2>
<p>Choosing which type of identity you are creating comes down to whether you are using a 3rd Party CA or not. If the
network does not have a 3rd Party Certificate configured the only option is to use the One Time Token identity.</p>
<p>If one or more 3rd Party CA is installed you will need to understand the intention of each 3rd Party certificate.</p>
<p>Each of the types of identities are secure it just depends on your actual network setup as to which type to choose. If
you don&#39;t know - just use the one time token identity. The identity can always be recreated at a later date and replaced
if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="one-time-token-ott">One Time Token (OTT)</h3>
<p>One time token identities are the type of identities available to all Ziti networks.  A one time token identity will
have a token generated at the time of the identity&#39;s creation.  This token is then submitted at some point in the future
as part of the <a href="enrolling.html">enrollment</a> process.  Once an identity is successfully enrolled - the one time token is
no longer valid and cannot be used to enroll the same identity again.</p>
<p>One time tokens are delivered from the Ziti Controller as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">jwt</a> and the token
expires 24 hours after the identity is created.  The token is downloadable via the basic UI provided in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YZLKMLV">Ziti Edge -
Developer Edition</a>. After you create a user you can go to the Identities page and
click the icon that looks like a certificate to download the .jwt file.</p>
<p>You can also create a one time token identity using the <code>ziti</code> cli tool available on the path of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YZLKMLV">Ziti Edge -
Developer Edition</a>.  This command will create a new identity and output the jwt
to the selected path. You can then transfer the .jwt file to its intended destination.</p>
<pre><code>#creates a new user named &quot;NewUser&quot;
ziti edge controller create identity user &quot;NewUser&quot; -o NewUser.jwt
</code></pre><h3 id="3rd-party-ca---overview">3rd Party CA - Overview</h3>
<p>The Ziti Controller is capable of using an existing PKI for authentication and authorization rather than to PKI
configured in the Ziti Controller.  Certificates that are not controlled by the Ziti Controller are referred to as &quot;3rd
party&quot;. If you have an existing PKI setup you wish to reuse or if you are just interested in learning how
to use a 3rd Party CA this section is for you.</p>
<div class="NOTE"><h5>Note</h5><p>Reusing a PKI is not a simple topic and managing and maintaining a PKI is out of the scope of this guide.</p>
</div>
<p>A 3rd Party CA will need to be created and the public certificate uploaded into the Ziti Controller. After using an
existing PKI to reuse/generate a certificate, the Ziti Controller will be to create identities which will be expected to
present a certificate during the connection process that is valid per the provided certificate.</p>
<h4 id="adding-a-3rd-party-ca-to-the-ziti-controller">Adding a 3rd Party CA to the Ziti Controller</h4>
<p>Adding a certifate to the Ziti Controller is easy using the Ziti Console provided in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YZLKMLV">Ziti Edge -

<h4 id="3rd-party-ca---one-time-token">3rd Party CA - One Time Token</h4>
<p>3rd Party CA OTT enrollment is closely related to <a href="#one-time-token-ott">OTT Enrollment</a>. The main difference is the
utilization of a 3rd party CA certificate rather than the configured Ziti Edge CA and PKI. In this method, the system
does not have access to the 3rd party CA private key and thus cannot provide CSR fulfillment capabilities. Instead it is
assumed that the enrolling device has a separate process to acquire signed certificates. Rather than submitting a CSR
the client uses an already acquired signed certificate as its client certificate for the enrollment request. The client
certificate is validated against the CA certificate tied to the one time token.</p>
<p>Similar to the <a href="#one-time-token-ott">OTT Enrollment</a> process, identities must be provisioned ahead of enrollment in
order to generate one time token required and to creat the jwt that can be delivered to enrolling devices. This means
that the provisioning of the Ziti Edge identities and the client certificates must be coordinated. Identities can be enrolled with a one time token flow similar to the <a href="#one-time-token-ott">one time token flow</a>.</p>
<h4 id="3rd-party-ca---auto-enrolled">3rd Party CA - Auto Enrolled</h4>
<p>CA Auto Enrollment is useful in situations where devices are provisioned with certificates en-mass that need to be able
to register as identities within Ziti Edge. This enrollment method allows for device provisioning processes to skip the
manual configuration of Ziti Edge and instead allow clients to present a signed client certificate to generate an
identity during the enrollment process. The identity will grant the client access to authenticate only - any
authorization will need to be done after the device identities have been created.</p>
<p>A certificate can only be used for one identity. The Ziti Edge system does not allow the same certificate to be used for
multiple identities. An enrollment request is comprised of a special enrollment URL used to perform an HTTP POST request
using the signed client certificate as the TLS client certificate and an optional JSON payload that allows the client to
specify the devices display name and internal username. See <a href="enrolling.html">enrollment</a> for more details on enrolling.</p>

<h2 id="enrolling-an-identity">Enrolling an Identity</h2>
<p>All connections made to the Ziti network leverage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication">mutual TLS</a>
which means every client needs a valid X509 certificate which it will present to the Ziti network during the connection
process. The process of obtaining a key/certificate pair and presenting it securely to the Ziti Controller is called
&quot;Enrollment&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>All identities need to be enrolled with the Ziti Controller so the Ziti Controller can authenticate the incoming connection.
This process is slightly different for each type of identity. NetFoundry has created a tool to aid the enrollment
process named <code>ziti-enroller</code>. It is recommended that you use <code>ziti-enroller</code> to complete the enrollment as the
process itself complex. Enrollers are available here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://netfoundry-clients.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ziti/0.5.8-2554/ziti-enroller.exe">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="https://netfoundry-clients.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ziti/0.5.8-2554/ziti-enroller-mac.tar.gz">MacOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://netfoundry-clients.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ziti/0.5.8-2554/ziti-enroller-linux.tar.gz">Linux</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="one-time-token-enrollment---internal-pki">One Time Token Enrollment - Internal PKI</h3>
<p>Perhaps the easiest path to an enrolled identity is by using the one time token enrollment flow. This flow leverages the
PKI configured in the Ziti Controller.  Using the one time token flow - the <code>ziti-enroller</code> will generate a private key
and a certificate signing request for the Ziti Controller to sign.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to enroll a one time token identity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="creating.html">create the Identity</a></li>
<li>download or copy the jwt - this file contains the single use token</li>
<li><p>run the <code>ziti-enroller</code> for your given operating system:</p>
<p>  ziti-enroller --jwt ${jwt_file}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="IMPORTANT"><h5>Important</h5><p>The output from the <code>ziti-enroller</code> is a json file which must be kept secure. This file contains within it the private key
used to generate a certificate request which was sent to the Ziti Controller and signed.  This file should not be
transferred or shared and should not be moved from the machine unless you are confident you understand the risks
involved in doing so.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="3rd-party-ca---one-time-token">3rd Party CA - One Time Token</h3>
<p>This process is similar to the One Time Token flow from above. This flow expects that a private key and certificate have
already been created on the machine that is about to enroll and that the certificate presented is valid to a CA already
uploaded to the Ziti Controller.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to enroll a 3rd Pary CA - one time token identity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="creating.html">create the Identity</a></li>
<li>download or copy the jwt - this file contains the single use token</li>
<li><p>run the <code>ziti-enroller</code> for your given operating system. Notice you can provide the name of the identity :</p>
<p>  ziti-enroller -v --jwt ${jwt_file} --cert ${identity_path_to_cert} --key ${identity_path_to_key} --idname ${identity_name}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3rd-party-ca---auto">3rd Party CA - Auto</h3>
<p>This enrollment process is almost entirely automated. With &quot;auto&quot; no identity needs to exist prior to enrollment. The
act of enrolling the identity actually creates the identity.  Like &quot;3rd Party CA - One Time Token&quot; - this flow expects
that a private key and certificate have already been created on the machine that is about to enroll and that the
certificate presented is valid to a CA already uploaded to the Ziti Controller. This flow also requires that a jwt
specifically created for enrollment be downloaded from the CA and the CA uploaded needs to be valid for
isAutoCaEnrollmentEnabled.</p>
<p>You can get the .jwt by downloading the file from:  <code>${controller_uri}/cas/${ca_id}/jwt</code></p>
