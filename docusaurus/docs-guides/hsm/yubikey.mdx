# YubiKey by Yubico

[Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/) is a manufacturer of HSM deviceis. A popular line of HSM produced by Yubico is the
YubiKey. This quickstart guide will use specific device from Yubico - the [YubiKey 5
nfc](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/).

## Overview

The [YubiKey 5 nfc](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) is a multi-purpose device with a few different
security-minded uses. One of the applications on the device is an application called PIV or "Personal Identity
Verification". PIV is a [standard published by
NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/piv/piv-standards-and-supporting-documentation) and describes the kinds of
credentials which make up the standard. PIV credentials have certificates and key pairs, pin numbers, biometrics
like fingerprints and pictures, and other unique identifiers. When put together into a PIV credential, it provides
the capability to implement multi-factor authentication for networks, applications and buildings.

In this quickstart, you will see the commands and tools needed to use a [YubiKey 5
nfc](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) with a Ziti Network. This document is intended to serve as a
quickstart. That means limited context will be provided for each step. When appropriate, there will be a small amount of

## Prerequistites

* [YubiKey 5 nfc](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) - You'll need one to use this
  quickstart!
* [OpenSC](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki) is installed and `pkcs11-tool` is either on the PATH or at a known
  location. Not required however this quickstart uses the `pkcs11-tool` to illustrate that the device is PKCS#11
  compliant. HSM manufacturers will generally provide a similar tool and often expand it's usage. See more below.
  [yubico-piv-tool](https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/) - YubiKey privides a similar tool to the
  `pkcs11-tool`. This tool is needed to be installed because it contains the pkcs#11 module (driver) for the HSM. As
  this is a tool specific to Yubico we've chosen to not use this in the following commands.
* Ensure the YubiKey is factory reset. To avoid any compliations with existing information in the YubiKey ensure the
  device is factory reset using the [YubiKey
  Manager](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-manager/).
* To successfully use the YubiKey, the libraries provided by the `yubico-piv-tool` must either be on the path
  or in a common location that is known to the OS. On linux this is likely done by the YubiKey software installation but
  on Windows you'll need to take any additional actions highlighted in the Windows-specific sections.
* Linux Only: If you're using linux - you'll need to follow the [build
  instructions](https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/) provided by Yubico. Before you can do anything with the
  Yubikey you'll need to make sure the `libykcs11.so` exists on your system. When creating this quickstart the library
  was built to `./yubico-piv-tool-2.0.0/ykcs11/.libs/libykcs11.so`.
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) was used to test this guide. An attempt was also made with [linux
  mint](https://linuxmint.com/) however the attempt failed when trying to compile the Yubikey software and was aborted.
  It would likely have worked if enough effort was put into discovering why that linux variant had issues pulling and
  compiling the necessary software. If you see strange errors when following this guide and are not using Ubuntu it may
  be related.
* ziti and ziti-tunnel are both downloaded and on the path.

## Let's Use the YubiKey!

Here's the list of steps we'll accomplish in this quickstart:

* Establish a bunch of environment variables to make it easy to copy/paste the other commands. You'll want to *look at
* Use the [Ziti CLI](https://github.com/openziti/ziti/releases/latest) to:
    * create two identities - one demonstrating an RSA key, one EC
    * enroll the identities
    * create a test service
    * create test router/service policies
* Use the pkcs11-tool provided by OpenSC to interact with the YubiKey to:
    * initialize the PIV app
    * create a key
* Use `ziti-tunnel` to enroll the identities using the YubiKey
* Use `ziti-tunnel` in proxy mode to verify things are working and traffic is flowing over the Ziti Network

:::caution
Do *NOT* use id `2` or `02` for any keys you add. Id `02` corresponds to the YubiKey's "Management Key". You will not be
able to write a key into this location. The error you will see will indicate: `CKR_USER_NOT_LOGGED_IN`.
:::

### Establish Environment Variables

Open a command line and establish the following environment varibles. Note that for the YubiKey we do _not_ use id `02`
as it appears to be reserved by the YubiKey.  The default SOPIN and PIN are used as well. When using the YubiKey Manager
software the "SO PIN" corresponds to the "Management Key" while "pin" is the same both here and in the YubiKey Manager.

### Putting It All Together

Above we've only shown the commands that need to run and not what the output of those commands would look like. Here
we'll see all the commands put together along with all the output from the commands. This section is long - you are
warned! Also note that this content is subject to change. If the output you see is not identical it's because the
software has changed since this information was captured. File an [issue](https://github.com/openziti/ziti-doc/issues)
if you'd like to see it updated.
