omissions in using the Software; (2) breach of this Agreement; and/or (3) violation of any applicable law, rule,
regulation, or third party right.

with this Agreement directly infringes such third party&#39;s U.S. copyright or patent rights. NetFoundry will pay
those costs and damages finally awarded against Customer in any such action that are specifically attributable to such
claim or those costs and damages agreed to in a monetary settlement of such action. If the Software becomes, or in

Agreement; (b) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing and remains functionally equivalent;
or (c) terminate all rights and licenses granted to Customer under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

property infringement claim. This Section states NetFoundry&#39;s entire liability and Customer&#39;s sole and
exclusive remedy for infringement claims and action. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on Customer notifying
NetFoundry promptly in writing of such action, giving NetFoundry sole control of the defense thereof and any related
settlement negotiations, and cooperating and, at NetFoundry&#39;s reasonable request and expense, assisting in such
defense. Customer will, at its own expense, defend and indemnify NetFoundry and its affiliates against any damages,
liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees)resulting from and claim arising
