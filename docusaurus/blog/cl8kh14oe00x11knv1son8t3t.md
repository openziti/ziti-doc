## OpenZiti is Participating in Hacktoberfest, Prost!

## What's Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a month long journey many take to get a free t-shirt. Wait, no, it's a community gathering to support the open source community and projects. Every year, during the month of October, [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) hosts an event in which developers around the world join together to contribute to open source. You can contribute by submitting changes ranging in difficulty from fixing a typo to implementing a full-fledged feature on a project. As the official [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/) says, "Quantity is fun, Quality is key."
