# Console Configuration

## Alternative Server Certificates

At the time of writing, ZAC 3.0+ is hosted by the controller, which is the likely direction of travel
for the future, and the current preferred configuration.

As mentioned in the [identity](../../reference/30-configuration/conventions.md#identity) section of the Conventions reference document, you can
use certificates from public CAs like Let's Encrypt and associate them with the controller config in order to
present valid certificates for the ZAC single page application.

The `alt_server_certs` configuration key is an array of certificate information, so the first-matched server
certificate is presented to the TLS client (in this case, a browser).

To configure this correctly for the ZAC, the certificate paths need to be added to the `alt_server_certs` array
in the `web` listener section, under the `client-management` named config section.

:::note Important note on listener
__The ZAC binding must share a web listener with the `edge-management` binding.__

If the `edge-client` and `edge-management` are not sharing a web listener (i.e. they are bound to separate
web listeners) then you must bind the ZAC to the listener where `edge-management` binding is configured.

### Creating a DNS Record

Before generating an SSL certificate, ensure you have a valid DNS record pointing to the public IP address of
your server. This can be done through your DNS provider’s control panel, dashboard, or directly via a domain
registrar.

:::note Important note on DNS
Ensure the DNS record for the Alternative Server Certificate is not the same DNS record used for the controller. This can cause issues when validating JWT tokens on the clients. This may show as `key is of invalid type: RSA verify expects *rsa.PublicKey` when enrolling a router.
:::

Ensure you wait for DNS propagation to complete before attempting ACME DNS-based challenge.

This may take a few minutes to a few hours, but you can use tools like [Google Admin Toolbox Dig](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/)
to track the progress on the propagation.

### Install Let’s Encrypt CertBot

General instructions for this can be found by visiting the
[Let's Encrypt Documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/), and  also by reviewing the documentation of
[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions). These documents go into detail about various bespoke
configuratons so you can choose the right one for your scenario.

A simple way to satisfy the DNS-based challenge from Let's Encrypt is to use the Certbot DNS plugin.
[CertBot DNS Plugins](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#dns-plugins).

These are specific to DNS providers, but you can see an example of how they should be used in
[this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-let-s-encrypt-wildcard-certificates-with-certbot)

### Configure DNS Provider Authentication

CertBot requires access to your DNS provider’s API to perform DNS-based domain validation. This is because
it provisions a TXT resource in the domain, as per [RFC8555](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-8.4).
For this you will need to look up how to create the token from your DNS provider.

Other mechanisms of satisfying the challenge are available. However, this method allows for better automation.

Read the documentation from [CertBot DNS Plugins](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#dns-plugins)
to determine how to configure this correctly for your setup.

### Obtain an SSL Certificate

Once all the above is correct, you can run CertBot using the DNS-based challenge. The following command
demonstrates the principle. You should change the DNS provider specific arguments to match your scenario.

```bash
sudo certbot certonly \
  --dns-digitalocean \
  --dns-digitalocean-credentials ~/certbot-creds.ini \
  -d <YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>
```

If all goes well, this request will generate an SSL certificate for your domain, which by default
will be stored in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/`, matching the example configuration given above.
