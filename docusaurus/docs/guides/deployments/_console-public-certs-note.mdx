As mentioned above, the ZAC will produce TLS warnings in the browser. It is encouraged to fix this.
Valid certificates will promote confidence in the implementation. Let's Encrypt provides a free, automated

See [**The Console and Alternative Server Certificates**](./console.mdx)
for details on how to integrate.
