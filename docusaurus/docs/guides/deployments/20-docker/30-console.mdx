This article is about enabling the console on a controller that is running in a container.

1. Configure the controller

    The console's `zac` binding must be on the same web listener as the controller's management API, i.e., the `edge-management` binding.

    <br />

    ```text
          - binding: zac
            options:
              location: /ziti-console
              indexFile: index.html
    ```

    - `location` is the filesystem path to the static files of the console. In the controller container, the usual path is `/ziti-console`.
    - `indexFile` property is the entry point to the console.

1. To apply the changes, the controller must be restarted.
1. Visit the console at `/zac/` on the controller's address.

    The console is now available at `https://<fqdn>:<port>/zac/`.

1. Log in to the console.

    The only available authentication method for the console SPA is username and password.

1. Console certificate option - The console is served from the controller's API and can be used with the default API certificate. The controller can be configured to present a different certificate for the console when the API is accessed by a distinct URL for the console. For more information about using alternative server certs with the controller, see: [the configuration reference for the `identity` property](/reference/30-configuration/conventions.md#identity).

## Upgrade

The controller container includes the latest version of the console. You can instead mount console versions >= 3.0.0.

1. Download a release.

    ```text
    wget https://github.com/openziti/ziti-console/releases/latest/download/ziti-console.zip
    ```

1. Unzip the static files and set read and list permission.

    ```text
    unzip -d ./ziti-console ./ziti-console.zip
    chmod -R a+rX ./ziti-console
    ```

1. Mount the console files read-only on the controller container.

    ```text
    services:
      ziti-controller:
        volumes:
          - ./ziti-console:/ziti-console:ro
    ```

1. Restart the controller service to apply the changes.

    ```text
    docker compose up ziti-controller --force-recreate
    ```
