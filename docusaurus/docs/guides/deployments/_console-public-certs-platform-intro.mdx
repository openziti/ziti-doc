## Using Public Certificates

It is possible to remove certificate based security warnings.

By default, the OpenZiti Controller is configured with a certificate issued by its self-signed PKI. Unless
you've specifically added this certificate to all your web browsers, this will result in modern browsers showing
a warning when accessing the console UI.

Although not strictly a security issue, it's convenient to use certificates from a widely trusted CA such
as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/), etc. Using a certificate from
a widely trusted CA will very likely ensure any console user does not receive this warning.

Assuming you are serving the console from the controller, you can configure the OpenZiti Controller to serve
an alternate server certificate using the `alt_server_certs` configuration stanza.
