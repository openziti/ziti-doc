# Tunnelers

OpenZiti Tunnelers can be configured to allow users to authenticate to the OpenZiti Controller with an external JWT 
signer. Every tunneler will have slightly different UX due to the differences in operating systems. See the 
[Tunnelers](../../../docs/reference/tunnelers/index.mdx) section of the reference documentation for more details.

There are numerous [Identity Providers](./identity-providers/README.mdx) documented to try to help you configure an 
IdP for external authentication.

If you want to use an identity provider that is not documented, please express your interest over in our
[Discourse forum](https://openziti.discourse.group/).
