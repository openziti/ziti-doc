# Troubleshooting OIDC

Getting an external authentication to successfully configured can be a difficult process. The 1.5+ version of the `ziti`
CLI contains a subcommand that will hopefully help administrators get the configuration correct.

The `ziti ops verify ext-jwt-signer oidc` subcommand is specifically useful to iterate through the process of setting up
an external JWT signer for OIDC.

## Usage

:::info
_All `ziti` CLI commands and subcommands have very good help available by simply typing `--help`._

<Details>

<summary>`ziti ops verify ext-jwt-signer oidc` Usage</summary>

```
Usage:
  ziti ops verify ext-jwt-signer oidc [flags]

Available Commands:


Flags:
      --access-token          Display the full Access Token to the screen. Use caution.
  -s, --additional-scopes     List of additional scopes to add
      --authenticate          Also attempt to authenticate using the supplied ext-jwt-signer
      --controller-url        The url of the controller
      --id-token              Display the full ID Token to the screen. Use caution.
  -r, --redirect-url          The expected redirect URL to listen to
      --refresh-token         Display the full Refresh Token to the screen. Use caution.

Flags related to logging in:
      --ca                    additional root certificates used by the Ziti Edge Controller
  -c, --client-cert           A certificate used to authenticate
  -k, --client-key            The key to use with certificate authentication
  -e, --ext-jwt               A file containing a JWT from an external provider to be used for authentication
  -f, --file                  An identity file to use for authentication
      --ignore-config         If set, does not use values from nor write the config file. Required values not specified will be prompted for.
  -p, --password              password to use for authenticating to the Ziti Edge Controller, if -u is supplied and -p is not, a value will be prompted for
      --read-only             marks this login as read-only. Note: this is not a guarantee that nothing can be changed on the server. Care should still be taken!
  -t, --token                 if an api token has already been acquired, it can be set in the config with this option. This will set the session to read only by default
  -u, --username              username to use for authenticating to the Ziti Edge Controller
  -y, --yes                   If set, responds to prompts with yes. This will result in untrusted certs being accepted or updated.

Common flags for all commands:
  -i, --cli-identity          Specify the saved identity you want the CLI to use when connect to the controller with
  -j, --output-json           Output the full JSON response from the Ziti Edge Controller
      --output-request-json   Output the full JSON request to the Ziti Edge Controller
      --timeout               Timeout for REST operations (specified in seconds)
      --verbose               Enable verbose logging
```

:::

The `verify ext-jwt-signer oidc` subcommand allows you to supply a few key values to initiate and complete an
[Authorization Code Flow with PKCE or PKCE flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/). Running the command will produce output 
into the terminal including:
* the ID token
* the Access token
* the Refresh token

## An Example 

Assume you have deployed a Keycloak instance and are looking to test the external JWT signer configuration. After 
following the appropriate documentation, you are ready to authenticate but experience a failure. Assuming the following:
* the controller exists at `https://controller.example.com`
* the external JWT signer is named `Keycloak`
* the Keycloak server is at `https://keycloak.example.com`
* the Keycloak server has a realm named `demo`

Issue this command (or similar for your environment) to initiate a PKCE flow and attempt to authenticate to the 
controller.

```text
ziti ops verify ext-jwt-signer oidc --controller-url https://controller.example.com --authenticate Keycloak
```

---

### Common Output

:::tip[User passes `--authenticate` to actually attempt to authenticate to the controller and succeeds]

<Details>

<summary>A full, successful `--authenticate` request</summary>
