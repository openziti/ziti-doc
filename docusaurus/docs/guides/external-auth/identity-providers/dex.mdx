The [dex IdP](https://dexidp.io/docs/configuration/) can be configured to federate identity to other IdPs. Doing so 
will allow you to provide a single identity back to OpenZiti. There is no dashboard need to configure OpenZiti with 
dex. All the values you need to come from the dex config file. For a more detailed guide on enabling dex with OpenZiti, 
see below. Use these values to configure an external JWT signer with dex.

:::note[a note about dex]
The dex IdP exclusively is a federating IdP. You must have a client id and secret from another IdP in order to 
authenticate.

| Field                 | Where to Find the Value in the dex Configuration                                         | Example                                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Issuer**            | In the dex config.yaml file, key **issuer** or from the `jwks_uri`                       | https://dex.doc.demo.openziti.org:5556      |
| **Client ID**         | In the dex config.yaml file, key staticClients.id                                        | openziti-dex-client                         |
| **Audience**          | Unless overridden, the same value as the **Client ID**                                   | openziti-dex-client                         |
| **External Auth URL** | The same value as the **Issuer**                                                         | https://dex.doc.demo.openziti.org:5556      |
| **JWKS Endpoint**     | Use the `jwks_uri` field from the './well-known/openid-configuration' endpoint           | https://dex.doc.demo.openziti.org:5556/keys |
| **Claims Property**   | Often `email`, but can also be `sub` or any other claim contained in the JWT             | email                                       |
| **Scopes**            | `openid` is always included. Often `email` but `profile` or any standard or custom scope | profile offline_access                      |

## Configure dex to Federate to GitHub

Since dex is entirely configured via the dex configuration file all examples will be shown as dex config file. The 
`config.yaml` file and `.env` file are show along with a sample docker command to run dex. Notice in the docker 
command a volume mount containing valid certificates is mounted allowing for dex to serve TLS from a public CA. Also 
worth noting is this configuration federates through to GitHub and requires the user to be part of the `openziti` org.

```example-yaml
@code: dex config.yaml File

issuer: https://dex.doc.demo.openziti.org:5556

web:
  http: ""  # Disable HTTP
  https: 0.0.0.0:5556
  tlsCert: /certs/live/doc.demo.openziti.org/fullchain.pem
  tlsKey: /certs/live/doc.demo.openziti.org/privkey.pem
storage:
  type: sqlite3
  config:
    file: /var/dex/dex.db

staticClients:
  - id: openziti-dex-client
    redirectURIs:
      - 'http://localhost:20314/auth/callback'
    name: 'OpenZiti DEX Integration'
    public: true

connectors:
- type: github
  id: github
  name: GitHub
  config:
    clientID: ${GITHUB_CLIENT}
    clientSecret: ${GITHUB_CLIENTSECRET}
    redirectURI: https://dex.doc.demo.openziti.org:5556/callback

    # List of org and team names.
    #  - If specified, a user MUST be a member of at least ONE of these orgs
    #    and teams (if set) to authenticate with dex.
    #  - Dex queries the following organizations for group information if the
    #    "groups" scope is requested. Group claims are formatted as "(org):(team)".
    #    For example if a user is part of the "engineering" team of the "coreos" org,
    #    the group claim would include "coreos:engineering".
    #  - If teams are specified, dex only returns group claims for those teams.
    orgs:
    - name: ${GITHUB_REQUIRED_ORG}
```

```example-text
@code: Docker .env File
GITHUB_CLIENT=_GITHUB_CLIENT_HERE_
GITHUB_CLIENTSECRET=_GITHUB_SECRET_HERE_
GITHUB_REQUIRED_ORG=openziti
```

Verify the proper volume mount exists and the dex container has access.
```example-text
@code: Example Docker Command
docker run --rm \
  --name dex \
  -v certs:/certs \
  --env-file .env \
  -v ./config.yaml:/dex-config.yaml \
  -p 5556:5556 \
  ghcr.io/dexidp/dex:latest dex serve /dex-config.yaml
```
