# AWS Cognito

<img src="/icons/logo-cognito.svg" alt="AWS Cognito logo" height="100px"/>

This section illustrates where the expected values are found within
[the Cognito dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/). For a more detailed guide on enabling Cognito with
OpenZiti, see below. Use these values to configure an external JWT signer. All of these values are found from the
AWS Cognito dashboard for the corresponding **User Pool** screen or via the OpenID discovery endpoint located at:

```example-text
@code: Example Cognito OpenID Discovery Endpoint
https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

:::note[notes about cognito]
* By default, Cognito will only work with **ID** tokens. You'll likely need to change the ext-jwt-signer token type 
  from **Access** to **ID**.
* Cognito's access token will not contain the user's email nor an audience. The audience field is mandatory as 
OpenZiti validates this claim within the JWT. **[This blog from AWS security](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-customize-access-tokens-in-amazon-cognito-user-pools/)** 
illustrates how one can modify access tokens and add an audience.
