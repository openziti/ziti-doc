# Google Workspace

<img src="@static/icons/logo-google.svg" alt="Google logo" height="100px"/>

This section illustrates where the expected values are found within the Google dashboards. There are at least two 
different consoles for Google, the [Google Auth Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview) 
and [Google Cloud APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). For a more detailed guide on 
enabling Google with OpenZiti, see below. Use these values to configure an external JWT signer. All of these values 
are found from the **client** or **credentials** screen in the corresponding overview page. 

:::note
Many people have reported Google is using opaque access tokens. If your controller logs an error similar to
`jwt failed to parse: token is malformed: token contains an invalid number of segments` change the token type from
**ACCESS** to **ID** on your ext-jwt-signer
:::

:::warning
Most of the errors when using Google as an identity provider are due to selecting/using the wrong type of client.
The only client type that currently works with OpenZiti is the **Universal Windows Platform** client type. If you use any 
of the other client types you will experience one sort of error or another. Also, only OpenZiti tunnelers will work with
this configuration. Google does not function standalone with BrowZer or Ziti Admin Console (ZAC)

## Create a Client/Credential

[Google Auth Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview)
and [Google Cloud APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) both allow you to generate 
credentials or clients. Although the terminology changes, both are the same at the end. If you create a credential 
in the APIs & Services screen, it will appear in the Google Auth Platform as a client. 

:::note
The screens shown below are from the [Google Cloud APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
console. If the screens do not look very close or identical you may be looking at the 
[Google Auth Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview)
:::

Begin, by creating a credential. From the APIs & Services console, click on Credentials, Create Credentials and 
choose OAuth client ID:

## Select Credential Type

When creating a credential/client there are different types available to select. Depending on the OpenZiti tech
you are trying to enable, you will need to select a different type. To enable authentication for BrowZer or the Ziti
Admin Console (ZAC) you will need to select the **Web application** type. For use with an OpenZiti tunneler you will
need to select **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)**.

## Common Errors With Google

If you are using any client type other than **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)** and trying to use Google with anything 
other than the OpenZiti tunnelers clients will likely experience errors. One such example is shown below.

```example-text
@code: Example error
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "error_description": "client_secret is missing."
}
```
