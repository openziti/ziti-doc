# Keycloak

<img src="/icons/logo-keycloak.svg" alt="Keycloak logo" height="100px"/>

The following fields are necessary in order to configure an external JWT signer with OpenZiti. This configuration will
enable authentication via JWTs obtained through an
[Authorization Code Flow with PKCE or PKCE flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/). These values are all found in the 
Keycloak realm Clients page on the specified client settings page or via the discovery endpoint. For Keycloak 
servers the discovery endpoint is generally at `https://${keycloak.server}/${realm}/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

The **OpenID discovery endpoint** can contain fields needed to configure the external jwt signer. Verify the URL used by
your Keycloak instance. Often the realm URL + '.well-known/openid-configuration' such as
https://keycloak.example.com/realms/zitirealm/.well-known/openid-configuration

## Create a Realm

A dedicated realm in Keycloak ensures **isolation, security, and better management** of users and applications. The  
**master realm** is generally used for admin tasks, not hosting apps. Creating a separate realm reduces security risks, 
simplifies maintenance, and allows custom authentication, roles, and policies tailored to your needs. It is 
recommended (but not mandatory) you create a dedicated realm.

Click the dropdown in the upper left and choose **Create realm**. From the **Create realm** page enter a **Realm name** 
and click the **Create** button.

## Create a Client

From the dedicated realm, click **Clients** and then choose **Create client**

:::info[Create a Client]
![Auth0 Applications](/img/idps/keycloak/create-client.png)
:::

## Create Client - General Settings

Under **General Settings**, ensure the **Client type** is set to **OpenID Connect**, enter a **Client ID** name and
click the **Next** button.

:::info[General Settings]
![Auth0 Applications](/img/idps/keycloak/create-client-1.png)
:::

## Create Client - Capability Config

On the **Capability Config** screen, ensure the **Authentication flow** has at a minimum the **Standard flow** selected.
It is the only flow that is required to be checked. Click **Next**.

:::info[Capability Config]

## Create Client - Login Settings

Finish creating the client by adding **Valid redirect URIs**, **Valid post logout redirect URIs** and **Web 
origins** as necessary.

## Assign an Audience

Access tokens are expected generated for a specific audience. This requires the access token to have an `aud` 
claim that is targeted for the API it's being sent to. To customize the access token's audience in Keycloak, after 
creating a client, ensure you're on the **Client details** screen then click the **Client scopes** tab and select it. On 
the details page, find the predefined **$\{clientName}-dedicated** scope and click it.

:::info[Open Dedicated Client Scope]

On the next page, click **Configure a new mapper**
:::info[Configure a new Mapper]
![Auth0 Applications](/img/idps/keycloak/configure-mapper.png)
:::

On the **Configure a new mapper** screen, select the **Audience** mapper.
:::info[Configure a new Mapper]
![Auth0 Applications](/img/idps/keycloak/configure-aud-mapper-1.png)
:::

On the **Add mapper** screen, fill out the **Name** field and add your desired audience to the **Included Custom 
Audience** field. Ensure the audience is added to the access token and optionally, add it to the ID token as well.

### Verifying Tokens in Keycloak

Keycloak has a very useful feature to allow you to view the tokens that will be generated. While on the client 
detail screen and **Client scopes** tab a somewhat hard to see sub-tab is available titled **Evaluate**, click on this tab.

From the next screen, choose any extra scopes you want to see applied to the token request, choose a user to view the 
token for and then click on the corresponding token to view, for example the **Generated access token** as shown below.
