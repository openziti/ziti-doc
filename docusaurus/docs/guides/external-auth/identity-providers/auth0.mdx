# Auth0

<img src="/icons/logo-auth0.svg" alt="Auth0 logo" height="100px"/>

This section illustrates where the expected values are found within the [Auth0 dashboards](https://auth0.com/). For a 
more detailed guide on creating an Auth0 application and API, see below.  Use these values to configure an external JWT
signer.

```example-text
@code: Example Auth0 OpenID Discovery Endpoint
https://${tenant}.${region}.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

| Field                 | Where to Find the Value                                                                                       | Example                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Issuer**            | Application Settings in **Basic Information**. The **Domain** of the app prefixed with "https://"             | https://dev-k1gpd4wpyslypklr.us.auth0.com/                      |
| **Client ID**         | Application Settings in **Basic Information**. The **Client ID**                                              | HTgNgEjHR9Q3krXiShYsrVOh6pRNrtH0q                               |
| **Audience**          | The **API Audience** on the APIs dashboard or in **General Settings** as the **Identifier** of the API        | https://your.openziti.controller.example.io                     |
| **External Auth URL** | The same value as the **Issuer**                                                                              | https://dev-k1gpd4wpyslypklr.us.auth0.com/                      |
| **JWKS Endpoint**     | Use the `jwks_uri` field from the OpenID discovery endpoint. Often the Auth0 domain + ".well-known/jwks.json" | https://dev-k1gpd4wpyslypklr.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json |
| **Claims Property**   | Often `email`, but can also be `sub` or any other claim contained in the JWT                                  | email                                                           |
| **Scopes**            | `openid` included by default then any other standard or custom scope such as `email`, `profile`etc.           | profile offline_access                                          |

## Get an Auth0 Account

If you don't already have an account you can sign up for a free account at https://auth0.com/signup

## Add an Application (if necessary)

Once you have an Auth0 account, expand **Application**, choose **Applications** again in the left navbar then find the 
**Create Application** button and click it:

:::info[Add Application]
![Auth0 Applications](/img/idps/auth0/create-app.png)
:::

### Choose the Type of Application

Give the application a name, then choose **Single Page Web Applications** and click **Create**.

:::info[Choose Application Type]
![Auth0 Applications](/img/idps/auth0/create-spa.png)
:::

Ignore the Quickstart tab and simply select the **Settings** tab to proceed.
:::info[Skip Quickstart Type Selection]
![Auth0 Applications](/img/idps/auth0/skip-quickstart.png)
:::

### Callback URLs

<CallbackUrls/>

From the **Settings** tab in the Auth0 portal, scroll down until you find the **Application URIs** section and add the 
URIs appropriate for the features you are enabling.

:::info[Example Callback URLs]
![Auth0 callbacks](/img/idps/auth0/callbacks.png)

## Add a New API

When using ext-jwt-signers with OIDC, OpenZiti validates the security token presented is intended for OpenZiti by 
looking for and using the `aud` (audience) field of the JWT.  This requires the token (the JWT) to have an audience 
specified and the ext-jwt-signer to match that audience. For Auth0, this is accomplished by creating an **API**.

From the left navbar in the Auth0 dashboard, click on `Application` -> `APIs` -> `Create API`

:::info[Create API]
![Auth0 Applications](/img/idps/auth0/create-api.png)
:::

Any name can be used but as the UI indicates the `Identifier*` field is used as the `aud`ience field of the JWT 
after successful authentication. Choose RFC 9068 as the JSON Web Token Profile.
