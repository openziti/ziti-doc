The [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE or PKCE flow](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) requires configuring callback URLs the
Identity Provider (IdP) will allow redirecting to. If the URL for a specific client is not specifically listed, the IdP
will deny the authentication request. Depending on the technology used to authenticate to the OpenZiti Network,
different URLs need to be specified. More than one URL is allowed to be configured. Decide if you are configuring the
IdP for use with tunnelers, with BrowZer or with both and add the appropriate callback urls.

In the Auth0 dashboard, with the application selected, choose the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "Application
URIs" section and add the URLs.

#### For Tunnelers

Tunnelers require an allowed callback URL of: `http://localhost:20314/auth/callback`.

#### For BrowZer

The URL to configure for BrowZer will vary depending on the BrowZer configuration. BrowZer requires a wildcard
certificate in order to be deployed and all services are delivered from this wildcard domain. You will need to add
the configured [wildcard domain](@openzitidocs/learn/quickstarts/browzer/example/#get-a-wildcard-certificate) as the
callback url.

#### For Ziti Admin Console (ZAC)

The URL to configure an IdP for so that ZAC will be able to authenticate will depend on how you deploy your ZAC. The 
current method recommended to deploy ZAC will deploy it on the same URL as the controller. For example: 
https://controller.example.com/zac/callback
