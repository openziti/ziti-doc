# BrowZer

BrowZer allows you to secure your web app using zero-trust technologies **without altering the web app itself** and 
without the need for a client-side agent install. 

You must bring your own identity provider, and BrowZer can integrate with all popular identity providers that support 
OpenID Connect (OIDC). You can use your existing identity provider, or you can set up a new one using the instructions 
in the [Identity Providers](./identity-providers/README.mdx) section.

Once your identity provider is set up, you can then authenticate your web app users onto your OpenZiti BrowZer overlay
network.  

Only authenticated users of your network will be able to see your web app -- it is safe and secure because it remains
hidden and undetectable by malicious actors.

If you want to use a self-hosted open source identity provider that is not listed above,
please express your interest over in our [Discourse forum](https://openziti.discourse.group/).

## Misconfigured Identity Providers

If the identity provider is misconfigured, BrowZer will surface the error shown below.
