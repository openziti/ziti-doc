Once you have a network - you are going to require a Ziti-aware client in order to access the network. There are
two types of clients and depending on your needs you'll choose to either use a tunneler or you will use an SDK to
securely access the network.

Choosing which type of client you will use to connect to a network is a straightforward process and comes down to a
single question. If you are you installing Ziti in front of an existing application which has already been developed and
deployed you need to use a [tunneler](/reference/tunnelers/index.mdx).  If you are developing a new product, starting from scratch and
you want to take advantage of a fully zero trust solution you will probably want to use an SDK.

## Tunnelers

A tunneler is purpose-built software designed to connect applications which are not Ziti-aware to the network.
