Once you have a Ziti Network - you are going to require a Ziti-aware client in order to access the network. There are
two types of clients and depending on your needs you'll choose to either use a tunneler or you will use an SDK to
securely access the Ziti Network.

Choosing which type of client you will use to connect to a Ziti Network is a straightforward process and comes down to a
single question. If you are you installing Ziti in front of an existing application which has already been developed and
deployed you need to use a [tunneler](../../../reference/tunnelers/).  If you are developing a new product, starting from scratch and
you want to take advantage of a fully zero trust solution you will probably want to use an SDK.
