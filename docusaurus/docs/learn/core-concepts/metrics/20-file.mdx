# File Reporter

The Ziti Controller event system can write metrics to a file for direct viewing or post-processing into a metrics system of your choice.

## Ziti Configuration

There are two independent configurations that need to be set up for metric event reporting to work:

1. **Report Interval:** The controller and routers need to have a metric reporting interval set.  The interval determines how often metrics will be sent to the controller and possibly written out to file
1. **Event Subscription:** The subscription is configured in the controller, and determines which of the reported metrics are written.

### Metrics Reporting
The reporting interval is defined in the `metrics.reportInterval` property. While the controller and each router can have a different reporting interval, we suggest that you set them all the same to make lining up metrics across the cluster easier.

Example:

```text
metrics:
  reportInterval: 20s
```

Routers support an additional configuration parameter `MessageQueueSize` which is the number of unsent metrics messages that can sit in the router metrics queue before metrics gathering is paused.

Example:

```text
metrics:
  reportInterval: 20s
  messageQueueSize: 20  // Default 10
```


### Metrics Writing

Writing of metrics is broken into two pieces:

1. **subscription:** Which metrics will be written
1. **hander:** how the metrics will be written

#### Metrics Subscription
The metrics subscription defines which metrics will be written and how they will be written. 

There are two parts to a metrics event reporter
The subscription has three components

1. **sourceFilter:** Which components to write metrics for. This is a regular expression. 
    * **ctrl_client:** Special marker for the controller
    * **Router ID:** Get metrics for one and only one router
    * **.\*:** Get metrics from the controller and all routers
1. **metricFilter:** Which metrics to report.  This is a regular expression
    * **.\*pool.\*:** Report only pool metrics
    * **.\*:** Report all metrics

##### Example:

```text
events:
  allControllerMetrics:
    subscriptions:
      - type: metrics
        sourceFilter: ctrl_client
        metricFilter: .*
  justEdgeRouterPoolMetrics:
    subscriptions:
      - type: metrics
        sourceFilter: .*
        metricFilter: .*pool.*
```

#### Metrics Handling

The metrics handler defined how metrics are to be written.  It is comprised of:

1. **type:** The type of handler.  Supported types are:
  * **file:** Metrics will be written to a file
1. **maxsizemb:** File rolling - log files will be rolled when they reach this size.  Default size is `10mb`.
1. **maxbackups** File rolling - the number of files to keep. Default is `0 (unlimited)`.
1. **format:** The format of the metric.  Supported formats are: `json`
1. **path:** The name of the file to write metrics to


##### File Rolling

files are rolled when they reach a size of `maxsizemb`. Files are renamed from `name.log` to `name-iso8601.log`

For example, `name-2022-06-07T18-50-44.568.log`

#### Example

Write 100mb files, saving 2 of them.

```text
    handler:
      type: file
      format: json
      maxsizemb: 100
      maxbackups: 2
      path: /tmp/controller-metrics.log
```


### Putting it all together

Controller configuration file:

```text
metrics:
  reportInterval: 20s

events:
  allControllerMetrics:
    subscriptions:
      - type: metrics
        sourceFilter: ctrl_client
        metricFilter: .*
    handler:
      type: file
      format: json
      maxsizemb: 50
      maxbackups: 2
      path: /tmp/controller-metrics.log

  justPoolMetrics:
    subscriptions:
      - type: metrics
        sourceFilter: .*
        metricFilter: .*pool.*
    handler:
      type: file
      format: json
      maxsizemb: 100
      maxbackups: 5
      path: /tmp/router-pool-metrics.log
```

Router configuration files:

```text
metrics:
  reportInterval: 20s
```
