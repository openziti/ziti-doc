# Ziti Identities

Ziti is built on the foundation of zero trust. A solid pillar of that foundation requires that all connections in a
Ziti-enabled network are authenticated.  Identities are the basis for Ziti authentication.  All devices connecting to a
Ziti network will have an Identity which is presented at the time of a connection being established by both the device
initiating the connection and the device receiving the incoming connection. Ziti implements [mutual
TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) in order to authenticate both sides of a connection.

Conceptually an identity can be thought of as congruent to a user account.  Identities are logical entities stored
inside the controller which map an X509 certificate to a particular named identity.  Identities exist not only to
authenticate connections but are also used to authorize identities within Ziti. See [Policies](../../../learn/core-concepts/security/authorization/policies/overview.mdx)
for more information on authorization of identities.

## 3rd Party Certificates

The certificate a Ziti Edge client presents can be generated by the controller using the configured PKI or this
certificate can come from an existing PKI not controlled by the controller. Certificates which are not created by
the controller are referred to as "3rd Party" because from the perspective of the controller the certificates
are not from the configured PKI.
