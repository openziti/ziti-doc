    <span style={{color: "var(--ifm-color-primary)", fontWeight:"bold"}}>OpenZiti</span> is a free and open source project focused on bringing zero trust networking principles directly into any application. The project provides all the pieces required to implement a zero trust overlay network and provides all the tools necessary to integrate zero trust into your existing solutions. The OpenZiti project believes the principles of zero trust shouldn't stop at your network, those ideas belong <span style={{color: "var(--ifm-color-primary)", fontWeight:"bold"}}>in your application</span>.

<h3>In OpenZiti You Will Find</h3>

* A zero trust [overlay mesh network](../../reference/glossary.md#network-overlay-overlay) composed of a controller, edge routers and fabric routers
* Numerous SDKs making it easy to embed zero trust principles directly into your application
* [Tunneling applications](../../reference/tunnelers/) providing zero trust access to those applications you cannot embed zero trust into directly
* Zero trust principles such as [authorize before connect](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authentication/auth),
[continual authorization](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authorization/auth),
[least-privilege access](/docs/learn/core-concepts/security/authorization/policies/overview)

OpenZiti makes it **easy** to embed zero trust, programmable networking directly into your app. With OpenZiti you can have **zero trust, high performance networking on any Internet connection**, without VPNs!
