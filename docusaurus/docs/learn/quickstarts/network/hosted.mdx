:::info
Quickstarts are short-lived networks that are great for learning how to use OpenZiti. For long-lived production deployments, see [the deployment guides](/deployments/20-controller/10-overview.mdx).
:::

You can absolutely choose to host your [network](../../../learn/introduction/index.mdx) anywhere you like.
It is not necessary for the server to be on the open internet. If it works better for you to deploy OpenZiti on your
own network, great, do that.  The only requirement to be aware of is that every piece of the network will need to be able to communicate to the controller and at least one edge router, which this quickstart will provide.

If you have a Linux server available on the open internet, or you will provision one for use with OpenZiti, that's the
ideal scenario. With a zero trust overlay network provided by OpenZiti, you can rest assured that your traffic is safe even when using commodity internet. Furthermore, you do not need to worry about being on a network you trust, as all networks are considered untrustworthy, even your work/home network!

## Installation

When starting out deploying a [network](../../../learn/introduction/index.mdx), we recommend you follow
and use the `expressInstall` function provided by the OpenZiti project. Once you're familiar with the network and
the configuration options available you'll be better equipped to make changes.

### Firewall

The first issue you will need to deal with is opening some ports. A network will consist of at least one controller and
at least one edge router. Both of these components will require ports to be open. For the controller you will need to
open a range of ports through your firewall:

- `8440/tcp`: edge controller providing router control plane
- `8441/tcp`: edge controller providing client sessions
- `8442/tcp`: edge router providing client connections
- `8443/tcp`: Ziti Admin Console (ZAC) [optional]

These are the arbitrary ports we'll use in this example for convenience when specifying the firewall exception as a port range.

## Express Install

### Prerequisites

:::note
Make sure you have `tar`, `hostname`, `jq` and `curl` installed before running the `expressInstall` one-liner.
:::

### `expressInstall` Setup {#expressinstall-setup}

`expressInstall` may be customized with environment variables. Consider creating a DNS name for this installation before running the script. By default, the
quickstart will install your Ziti network's PKI and configuration files in `${HOME}/.ziti/quickstart/$(hostname -s)`. You may choose a different location by defining `ZITI_HOME=/custom/path/to/quickstart`. If you do customize `ZITI_HOME` then you should also make this assignment in your shell RC, e.g., `~/.bashrc` for future convenience.

You will almost certainly want to use the **public** DNS name
of your instance. It is possible to use an IP address, but a DNS name is a more flexible option, which will be important if the IP ever changes.

The quickest and easiest thing to do, is find your external DNS name and set it into the `EXTERNAL_DNS` environment
variable. You may skip setting `EXTERNAL_DNS` if you don't need to configure the advertised DNS Subject Alternative Name (SAN). For example,

```text
export EXTERNAL_DNS="acme.example.com"
```

```text
export EXTERNAL_IP="$(curl -s eth0.me)"       
export ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_IP_OVERRIDE="${EXTERNAL_IP}"
export ZITI_CTRL_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS="${EXTERNAL_DNS:-${EXTERNAL_IP}}"
export ZITI_CTRL_ADVERTISED_PORT=8440
export ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS="${EXTERNAL_DNS:-${EXTERNAL_IP}}"
export ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT=8441
export ZITI_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS="${EXTERNAL_DNS:-${EXTERNAL_IP}}"
export ZITI_ROUTER_IP_OVERRIDE="${EXTERNAL_IP}"
export ZITI_ROUTER_PORT=8442
```

### Run `expressInstall`

As with any script that is downloaded and run from the internet, we recommend you examine 
the script before running it locally. This script is provided as a convenience
method for installing an environment quickly and easily.

```text
source /dev/stdin <<< "$(wget -qO- https://get.openziti.io/ziti-cli-functions.sh)"; expressInstall
```

### `systemd` {#systemd}

This assumes you already ran `expressInstall` on a Linux server. If it's available on your system, then it is recommended to use `systemd` to manage your controller and router processes. This
is useful to make sure the controller can restart automatically should you shutdown/restart the server. To generate the `systemd` unit files, run:

```text
createControllerSystemdFile
createRouterSystemdFile "${ZITI_ROUTER_NAME}"
```

Example output:

```text
$ createControllerSystemdFile
Controller systemd file written to: /home/ubuntu/.ziti/quickstart/ip-172-31-23-18/ip-172-31-23-18-edge-controller.service

$ createRouterSystemdFile "${ZITI_ROUTER_NAME}"
Router systemd file written to: /home/ubuntu/.ziti/quickstart/ip-172-31-23-18/ip-172-31-23-18-edge-router.service
```

#### The helper functions vs systemd

The set of startController/stopController, startRouter/stopRouter are functions declared in the 
[the ziti-cli-function.sh helper script](https://get.openziti.io/ziti-cli-functions.sh) and are useful for running
the controller and router directly in your shell. These functions are not meant to work with systemd-enabled installs. If
you are enabling systemd, use `systemctl` to start/stop the components. During the expressInstall, the controller and router
were started using the helper scripts to complete the installation. Both should not be running, but before you run the 
controller and router with `systemd` you need to stop them if they're currently running:

```text
stopRouter 
stopController 
```

Example output:

```text
$ stopRouter 
INFO: Router stopped.

$ stopController 
INFO: Controller stopped.
```

After the `systemd` service units are generated, you can then install them by running:

```text
sudo cp "${ZITI_HOME}/${ZITI_CTRL_NAME}.service" /etc/systemd/system/ziti-controller.service
sudo cp "${ZITI_HOME}/${ZITI_ROUTER_NAME}.service" /etc/systemd/system/ziti-router.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now ziti-controller
sudo systemctl enable --now ziti-router
```

Now, both the controller and the edge router will restart automatically if the machine reboots!  
After a few seconds you can then run these commands and verify systemd has started the processes 
and see the status:

```text
sudo systemctl -q status ziti-controller --lines=0 --no-pager
sudo systemctl -q status ziti-router --lines=0 --no-pager
```

Example output:

```text
$ sudo systemctl -q status ziti-controller --lines=0 --no-pager

## Adding Environment Variables Back to the Shell

If you log out and log back in again you can source the *.env file located in `ZITI_HOME`.

```text
source ~/.ziti/quickstart/$(hostname -s)/$(hostname -s).env
```

Example output:

```text
$ source ~/.ziti/quickstart/$(hostname -s)/$(hostname -s).env
adding /home/ubuntu/.ziti/quickstart/ip-10-0-0-1/ziti-bin/ziti-v0.20.2 to the path

$ echo $ZITI_HOME
/home/ubuntu/.ziti/quickstart/ip-10-0-0-1
```

## Next Steps

- Now that you have your network in place, you probably want to try it out. Head to the
  [Your First Service](../services/index.md) quickstart and start learning how to use OpenZiti.
- [Install the console](../zac/index.mdx) (web UI)
- Add a Second Public Router: In order for multiple routers to form transit links, they need a firewall exception to expose the "link listener" port. The default port is `10080/tcp`.
