:::info
Quickstarts are short-lived networks that are great for learning how to use OpenZiti. For long-lived production deployments, see [the deployment guides](/deployments/20-controller/index.mdx).
:::

This page will show you how to get your [network](../../../learn/introduction/index.mdx) up and running 
quickly and easily, entirely locally. Since you'll be running everything locally, you'll have no issues communicating
between network components. All the processes will run locally, and you'll be responsible for starting and stopping them
when you want to turn the overlay network on or off.

## Prerequisites

:::note
Make sure you have `tar`, `hostname`, `jq` and `curl` installed before running the `expressInstall` one-liner.
:::

There is not much preparation necessary to getting up-and-running locally. At this time, this guide expects that
you'll be running commands within a `bash` shell. If you're running Windows, you will need to make sure you have 
Windows Subsystem for Linux installed for now. We plan to provide a Powershell script in the future, but for now the
script requires you to be able to use `bash`. Make sure your local ports 1280, 6262, 10000 are free before running the
controller. These ports are the default ports used by the controller. Also ensure ports 10080 and 3022 are open as these 
are the default ports the edge router will use.

## Run `expressInstall` One-liner

Running the latest version of Ziti locally is as simple as running this one command:

```text
source /dev/stdin <<< "$(wget -qO- https://get.openziti.io/ziti-cli-functions.sh)"; expressInstall
```

This script will perform an 'express' install of Ziti which does the following:

* download the latest version of the OpenZiti binary (`ziti`)
* extract the binary into a predefined location: ~/.ziti/quickstart/$(hostname -s)
* create a full PKI for you to explore
* create a controller configuration using default values and the PKI created above
* create an edge-router configuration using default values and the PKI created above 
* add helper functions and environment variables to your shell (explore the script to see all)

## Start the Components

Once the latest version of Ziti has been downloaded and added to your path, it's time to start your controller and 
edge-router.

## Start Your Controller

```text
startController
```

Example output:

```text
$ startController
ziti-controller started as process id: 1286. log located at: /home/vagrant/.ziti/quickstart/bullseye/bullseye.log
```

### Verify the Controller is Running

After running `expressInstall`, you will have environment variables set named `ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS` and 
`ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT`. After the controller has started, your controller should be listening at that 
address:port combination. (Note, if you do not have these environment variables, you've probably closed your shell and opened
it up again. You can get the environment variables by sourcing the ".env" file. 
[See the section at the bottom of the page](#sourcing-the-env-file)
for details)

You can see what your value is set to by running 
`echo ${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS}:${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT}`. This value defaults to: 
`$(hostname -s):1280`. Make sure the controller is available by trying to curl to the address, and then start the edge router. 


```text
curl -sk "https://${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS}:${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT}"
```

Example output: 
```text
{"data":{"apiVersions":{"edge":{"v1":{"apiBaseUrls":["https://your.hostname:1280/edge/client/v1"],"path":"/edge/client/v1"}},"edge-client":{"v1":{"apiBaseUrls":["https://your.hostname:1280/edge/client/v1"],"path":"/edge/client/v1"}},"edge-management":{"v1":{"apiBaseUrls":["https://your.hostname:1280/edge/management/v1"],"path":"/edge/management/v1"}}},"buildDate":"2023-06-23T15:08:25Z","revision":"65d1dda821a3","runtimeVersion":"go1.20.5","version":"v0.28.4"},"meta":{}}
```

### Start Your Edge Router

Now that the controller is ready, you can start the edge router created with the 'express' process. You can start this 
router locally by running:

```text
startRouter
```

Example output:

```text
$ startRouter
Express edge router started as process id: 1296. log located at: /home/vagrant/.ziti/quickstart/bullseye/bullseye-edge-router.log
```

You can verify the edge router is listening by finding the value of `$ZITI_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS:$ZITI_ROUTER_PORT`.
Again, this will default to using `$(hostname -s)` as the host name and port 3022.

### Stopping the Controller and Router

```text
stopRouter 
stopController 
```

Example output:

```text
$ stopRouter 
INFO: Router stopped.

$ stopController 
INFO: Controller stopped.
```

## Testing Your Overlay

At this point you should have a functioning [network](../../../learn/introduction/index.mdx). The script 
you sourced provides another function to login to your network. Try this now by running `zitiLogin`. You should see 
something similar to this:
```text
$ zitiLogin
Token: 40d2d280-a633-46c9-8499-ab2e005dd222
Saving identity 'default' to ${HOME}/.ziti/quickstart/My-Mac-mini/ziti-cli.json
```

You can now use the `ziti` CLI to interact with Ziti!. The
`ziti` binary is not added to your path by default but will be available at `"${ZITI_BIN_DIR-}/ziti"`. Add that folder
to your path, alias `ziti` if you like. Let's try to use this command to see if the edge router is online by running:
`"${ZITI_BIN_DIR-}/ziti" edge list edge-routers`.

```text
$ "${ZITI_BIN_DIR-}/ziti" edge list edge-routers
id: rhx6687N.P    name: My-Mac-mini    isOnline: true    role attributes: {}
results: 1-1 of 1
```

Horray! Our edge router shows up and is online!

## Run Your First Service

You can try out creating and running a simple echo service through ziti by running the `first-service` tutorial.

```text
$ "${ZITI_BIN_DIR-}/ziti" demo first-service
```


## Customizing the Express Install

You can influence and customize the express installation somewhat if you wish. This is useful if trying to run more than
one instance of Ziti locally. The most common settings you might choose to customize would be the ports used or the name
of the network. 

### Configuration File Location

You can change the location of the configuration files output by setting the `ZITI_NETWORK` environment variable prior 
to running `expressInstall`. However, if you do this you will also need to set other environment variables as well. 
Please realize that if you change these variables each of the "hostname" variables will need to be addressable:

* ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS
* ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT
* ZITI_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS
* ZITI_ROUTER_PORT

Here is an example which allows you to put all the files into a folder called: `${HOME}/.ziti/quickstart/newfolder`, uses
a host named 'localhost', and uses ports 8800 for the edge controller and 9090 for the edge router:

```text
ZITI_NETWORK="newfolder"; \
ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS=localhost; \
ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT=8800; \
ZITI_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS=localhost; \
ZITI_ROUTER_PORT=9090; \
source ziti-cli-functions.sh; expressInstall
```

## Sourcing the Env File

In the case you close your shell and you want to get the same environment variables back into your shell, you can just 
source the "env" file that is placed into the location you specified. This file is usually located at:
`$HOME/.ziti/quickstart/$(hostname)/$(hostname).env`. You can source this file to place the environment variables back
into your shell.

```text
source $HOME/.ziti/quickstart/$(hostname)/$(hostname).env
```

## Next Steps

- Now that you have your network in place, you probably want to try it out. Head to the
  [Your First Service](../../quickstarts/services/index.md) quickstart and start learning how to use OpenZiti.
- [Install the console](../../quickstarts/zac/index.mdx) (web UI)
- Add a Second Public Router: In order for multiple routers to form transit links, they need a firewall exception to expose the "link listener" port. The default port is `10080/tcp`.
