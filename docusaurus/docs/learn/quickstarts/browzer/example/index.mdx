This page will demonstrate adding BrowZer to an existing network that was started using the
["host it anywhere" quickstart](/learn/quickstarts/network/hosted.mdx). It will use Ubuntu Linux as well, if
your Linux distribution is different, change the commands accordingly. The August 18 2023 Ziti TV features a full 
walkthrough and explanation of this whole page. If you are interested in watching a narrated and explained run
through of this page, watch the video and follow along with the doc here.

### Before you Begin

This guide will use BASH. If you're using a different shell, it's up to you to translate any commands that don't work
correctly (or run a BASH shell). This guide will expect you have set a variable named `wildcard_url` which represents
the root domain you want to enable BrowZer with. For this example, this guide uses and references this value 
for the `wildcard_url=browzerexample.demo.openziti.org`. <Highlight style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>(Make sure you set 
this value)</Highlight>

This quickstart will use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to obtain a wildcard certificate. You'll need to be
familiar with Docker and have it installed to proceed, or you'll need to figure out alternative ways to obtain
a wildcard certificate.

If you already have an existing network, you'll likely want to skim through this document and pick out the
sections that are relevant to your configuration.

If you lose your shell, one or more important variables may be lost. It is probably easiest to start again and follow
this guide, or you will need to ensure the variables are reset in the shell.

BrowZer also leverages an OIDC provider. Configuring and picking an OIDC provider are topics largely out of scope
for this document. This example will choose to use a provider that can delegate to other providers, hopefully making
it simple to follow this guide. We'll be using [Auth0](https://auth0.com) in this guide. 

---

### Get a Wildcard Certificate

First, to obtain the a wildcard certificate, I used Docker to run [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). 
On the Certbot site there are instructions illustrating how to use Certbot. I chose to use Docker to run Certbot
instead of having to install Certbot on the machine. I was able to generate a wildcard certificate from LetsEncrypt for the
`${wildcard_url}` domain using the [DNS challenge method](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge).  Also notice that Certbot can contact you as a 
reminder that your certificates are expiring. LetsEncrypt certs are only valid for 90 days, if you follow these
instructions remember that and plan on rotating the certs often. Set `your_email` as shown below and obtain
certificates from LetsEncrypt now:

<Details>
<summary>Run Certbot via Docker</summary>

```
your_email="your.email@someserver.com"
sudo docker run -it --rm --name certbot \
  -v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
  -v "/var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt" \
  certbot/certbot certonly -d "*.${wildcard_url}" \
                  --manual \
                  --preferred-challenges dns \
                  --email "${your_email}" \
                  --agree-tos
```

</Details>

---

### Enable Certificate Access by Specific Users

Certbot will make the files it creates available to root only (a good practice). If you run your network as root, this
you'll have no problems but generally, it's a better practice to not run as root when you don't need to. In order to run
this example as "us" (not the root user) we'll need to grant specific users the ability to read the files.  

A flexible way to allow other processes to use/access these files is to make a new group and a new user, that is what
is shown below. In linux, groups and users are assigned ids. 2171 looks like "ziti" so we'll use UID 2171 and GID 2171.
The example below will make a new group named `zitiweb`. This group will then be granted ownership of the `letsencrypt`
folder via chown. Changing the ownership of the files to the group will allow any user in that group the ability to read
these files so be careful granting this group to users. Then we'll add the user we are currently logged in with to that 
group so that "we" can see the files for debugging or other purposes. Finally, we'll make a `ziggy` user that is also in
this group so that if we want to, we can run processes as ziggy. Please plan accordingly here. This is just a reasonable 
example to follow to get you going, change it to suit your needs and do not take this example as authoritative. There
are many ways to solve this problem, it's up to you to pick 'the best' way.

<Details>
<summary>Example Changing LetsEncrypt Permissions</summary>

```text
sudo groupadd -g 2171 zitiweb
sudo useradd -u 2171 -M ziggy
sudo usermod -aG zitiweb ziggy
sudo usermod -aG zitiweb $USER
sudo chown -R root:zitiweb /etc/letsencrypt/
sudo chmod -R g+rX /etc/letsencrypt/
```

You will want to enable the new group permissions in the current shell. Log out of your current session and log back
in again. Doing so will enable the new group permission in your shell. After, set the `wildcard_url` variable again.
Once set, verify you can access to the certificates:
```text
ls -l /etc/letsencrypt/live/${wildcard_url}/
```
You should see something similar to:
```text
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 root zitiweb 692 Aug 17 21:12 README
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root zitiweb  56 Aug 17 21:12 cert.pem -> ../../archive/browzerexample.demo.openziti.org/cert1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root zitiweb  57 Aug 17 21:12 chain.pem -> ../../archive/browzerexample.demo.openziti.org/chain1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root zitiweb  61 Aug 17 21:12 fullchain.pem -> ../../archive/browzerexample.demo.openziti.org/fullchain1.pem
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root zitiweb  59 Aug 17 21:12 privkey.pem -> ../../archive/browzerexample.demo.openziti.org/privkey1.pem
```
</Details>

---

### Install Ziti

BrowZer is built around OpenZiti. You'll need a network deployed. Since this guide is using
a legitimate 3rd party verifiable certificate from LetsEncrypt, we'll deploy a brand new network by 
following the steps outlined in the ["host it anywhere"](/learn/quickstarts/network/hosted.mdx)
quickstart with <Highlight style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>one important exception</Highlight>! 
We are going to set two variables before running the quickstart to allow the servers to use the LetsEncrypt
wildcard certificate:

<Details>
<summary>Setup for Alternative Server Certs</summary>

Since we have just obtained some LetsEncrypt certificates, we'll enable OpenZiti with
Alternative Server Certs __immediately__! To do that we'll set two new variables
introduced with v0.29.0. Notice that the `${wildcard_url}` variable needs to be set if it's not already set:

```text
export ZITI_PKI_ALT_SERVER_CERT="/etc/letsencrypt/live/${wildcard_url}/fullchain.pem"
export ZITI_PKI_ALT_SERVER_KEY="/etc/letsencrypt/live/${wildcard_url}/privkey.pem"
```
</Details>

#### Run the Ziti Quickstart

With the `ZITI_PKI_ALT_*` environment variables set, we are ready to follow the 
__["host it anywhere" quickstart](/learn/quickstarts/network/hosted.mdx)__ instructions.  Run the quickstart
and return here when complete.

<Details>
<summary>Verify that Ziti is Listening</summary>

After completing the quickstart, you should be able to access the controller at both the alternate server cert url.
Notice there's no need for 'insecure' (-sk) curl mode for the`${wildcard_url}` URL:

```text
curl https://ctrl.${wildcard_url}:${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT}
```
and we should be able to curl to the non-alternative server url. Note for this we need to use `-sk` since this will
be the self-signed PKI endpoint:
```text
curl -sk https://${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS}:${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT}
```
</Details>

---

### Add WebSocket Support

BrowZer operates in a web browser. For it to connect to a router, BrowZer will attempt to connect to the router
using a [web socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). We'll need to provision an edge router on the network that supports 
[web sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). We will do that by modifying the configuration of the router provisioned in the quickstart.

<Details>
<summary>Update edge router for WebSocket Support</summary>

After completing the quickstart, you will have an edge router configuration file in the user's home directory.
Use your favorite editor, such as [`vim`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) to edit the file:

```text
vi $ZITI_HOME/${ZITI_NETWORK}-edge-router.yaml
```

Locate the "binding" section, and add a section that looks like this. Make sure to change the `address` and `advertise`
fields accordingly to fit your `${wildcard_url}` value:
```text
  - binding: edge
    address: wss:0.0.0.0:8447
    options:
      advertise: ws.browzerexample.demo.openziti.org:8447
      connectTimeoutMs: 5000
      getSessionTimeout: 60
```

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Restart the Edge Router</summary>

After updating the router's configuration file you'll need to restart the router:
```text
sudo systemctl restart ziti-router
```
</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Verify the edge router is Websocket Enabled</summary>

After the router restarts you'll be able to verify the router is properly configured. The following curl statement
should succeed and return a 404 message similar to the one shown below. Note port 8447 is used, if you change this
port you will obviously need to change the port number to the one you chose:

```text
curl https://ws.${wildcard_url}:8447
```

</Details>

---

### Install the Ziti Admin Console (ZAC)

In this example, we will be protecting the Ziti Administration Console (ZAC) with BrowZer. That means we'll need to
install ZAC first. Follow [the ZAC install guide](../../../quickstarts/zac/index.mdx).
After installing ZAC, continue.

---

### Configure the OIDC Provider

As stated in the ["Before You Begin"](#before-you-begin) section, we will be using Auth0 for this quickstart. Lett's
configure Auth0 to be the BrowZer OIDC provider.

* Begin by signing up and authenticating to Auth0.
* Follow the 'vanillajs' quickstart from Auth0: https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs/interactive
* Configure the Callback URLs and Logout URLs. Replace the values accordingly, for me, I used:
  the value `https://*.browzerexample.demo.openziti.org:8446`

---

## Create a BrowZer env File

At this point we have a functioning network. We're ready to start BrowZer-specific configuration.
First we need to decide/find an OIDC provider.  

Set a shell variable named `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and set it to the value shown on the "Basic Information" page in Auth0. Then
set a shell variable named `AUTHO_CLIENTID`. For me, this looked like this:

```text
AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-b2q0t23rxctngxka.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENTID=mKWvp7xJHWxHKPf4eol4VwZxRCmdJIMy
```

<Details>
<summary>Generate the BrowZer.env File</summary>

:::caution Warning
Make sure all variables listed below are set in your shell before running
:::

Now copy and paste this command to generate the browzer.env file.

```text
export NODE_ENV=production

echo browzer env file written to: $ZITI_HOME/browzer.env
```

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Inspect the browzer.env File</summary>

You should see something like:
```text
browzer env file written to: /home/ubuntu/.ziti/quickstart/ip-172-31-47-200/browzer.env
```

Open this file up and visually inspect it to verify the file seems to be full, complete and not missing anything
obvious. If you had verified all the variables used in the previous command were set, this file will be correctly
created.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Install BrowZer</summary>

BrowZer is ready to be installed. The [main BrowZer page](../index.mdx) has two sections showing you how to
install BrowZer either by [cloning from GitHub](../index.mdx#cloning-from-github)
or by [Running via Docker](../index.mdx#running-via-docker). I have
used the "clone" approach to run my BrowZer (and ZAC).

Follow one of those methods and ensure BrowZer is up and running.

```text
browzer env file written to: /home/ubuntu/.ziti/quickstart/ip-172-31-47-200/browzer.env
```

Open this file up and visually inspect it to verify the file seems to be full, complete and not missing anything
obvious. If you had verified all the variables used in the previous command were set, this file will be correctly
created.

</Details>

---

## Prepare the Network

For the following steps, make sure you have all the variables set and make sure you have logged into the controller:
```text
ziti edge login -u $ZITI_USER -p $ZITI_PWD -y ${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS}:${ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_ADVERTISED_PORT}
```

<Details>
<summary>Configure the External JWT Signer and Auth Policy</summary>

```text
echo "configuring OpenZiti for BrowZer..."
ziti_object_prefix=browzer-auth0
issuer=$(curl -s ${ZITI_BROWZER_OIDC_URL}/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq -r .issuer)
jwks=$(curl -s ${ZITI_BROWZER_OIDC_URL}/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq -r .jwks_uri)

echo "OIDC issuer   : $issuer"
echo "OIDC jwks url : $jwks"

ext_jwt_signer=$(ziti edge create ext-jwt-signer "${ziti_object_prefix}-ext-jwt-signer" "${issuer}" --jwks-endpoint "${jwks}" --audience "${ZITI_BROWZER_CLIENT_ID}" --claims-property email)
echo "ext jwt signer id: $ext_jwt_signer"

auth_policy=$(ziti edge create auth-policy "${ziti_object_prefix}-auth-policy" --primary-ext-jwt-allowed --primary-ext-jwt-allowed-signers ${ext_jwt_signer})
echo "auth policy id: $auth_policy"
```

After running the commands listed above, you should see output that confirms an `ext-jwt-signer` and `auth-policy` were
created successfully. It should look similar to what is shown below. Ensure the id's for the signer and auth policy
have some value and are not blank:
```text
configuring OpenZiti for BrowZer...
OIDC issuer   : https://dev-b2q0t23rxctngxka.us.auth0.com/
OIDC jwks url : https://dev-b2q0t23rxctngxka.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json
ext jwt signer id: 23sRIAoaPqh9RDoFO8iwGZ
auth policy id: 6EbCIB8ke40SI8eQxc3O0X
```

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Add a Service to Access an HTTP Web App</summary>

To enable access to the ZAC using BrowZer we need to make a service. Things to notice here are that we are using the
HTTP port (the BrowZer Bootstrapper will provide HTTPS) and we're using the default port of 1408. Ensure the variables
referenced are all set accordingly and then copy/paste these commands:

```text
intercept_address="${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.ziti"
intercept_port=80
offload_address=127.0.0.1
offload_port=1408

function createService {
ziti edge create config ${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.host.config host.v1 '{"protocol":"tcp", "address":"'"${offload_address}"'", "port":'${offload_port}'}'
ziti edge create config ${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.int.config  intercept.v1 '{"protocols":["tcp"],"addresses":["'"${intercept_address}"'"], "portRanges":[{"low":'${intercept_port}', "high":'${intercept_port}'}]}'
ziti edge create service "${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}" --configs "${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.host.config","${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.int.config"
ziti edge create service-policy "${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.bind" Bind --service-roles "@${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}" --identity-roles "#${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.binders"
ziti edge create service-policy "${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.dial" Dial --service-roles "@${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}" --identity-roles "#${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.dialers"
}

function deleteService {
ziti edge delete config  where 'name contains "'"${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}"'."'
ziti edge delete service where 'name = "'"${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}"'"'
ziti edge delete sp      where 'name contains "'"${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}"'."'
}

createService

```

Verify the commands all succeed (no errors shown) and the output looks similar to this after running:
```text
New config brozac.host.config created with id: 5i85SF4pnehz1LEjJNvCtH
New config brozac.int.config created with id: 2p8xuev7Vb9NzuZoEGi4tq
New service brozac created with id: 5Ry0BOMr6VJGQjF51LdDxv
New service policy brozac.bind created with id: 8EoBqEhKeIKQLQxY5zr3Z
New service policy brozac.dial created with id: 1TUzPYdN3GpGdA4k9Uauv3
```

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Associate/Update Identities with the Auth Policy</summary>

Now we need to associate the claims presented by the OIDC provider with one or more identities inside the
network. Since we have decided to use Auth0, in the previous step we were able to create an `ext-jwt-signer` and 
reference the claim named `email`. Since we chose Auth0, I know that it will provide this particular claim to OpenZiti
after the user logs into the OIDC provider. If your OIDC provider doesn't provide `email`, you'll have to 
learn/explore/understand how the OIDC provider you're using works. It's out of scope of this document to provide
that sort of insight. Set a variable named `ZITI_BROWZER_IDENTITIES` and assign it an email address you plan to use:

```text
ZITI_BROWZER_IDENTITIES="clint.dovholuk@company.name"
```

After create a __space__ delimited list (one value/email is fine too), copy and paste the following command:

```text
echo "creating users specified by ZITI_BROWZER_IDENTITIES: ${ZITI_BROWZER_IDENTITIES}"
for id in ${ZITI_BROWZER_IDENTITIES}; do
ziti edge create identity "${id}" --auth-policy ${auth_policy} --external-id "${id}" -a "${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.dialers"
done

#ziti edge update identity "${id}" -a $(ziti edge list identities 'name="'${id}'"' -j | jq -r '.data[].roleAttributes | map(. // "") | @csv'),"${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.dialers"
ziti edge update identity "${ZITI_ROUTER_NAME}" -a "${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}.binders"
```

After you run that command you should see output looking similar to this:
```text
creating users specified by ZITI_BROWZER_IDENTITIES: clint.dovholuk@company.name
New identity clint.dovholuk@company.name created with id: hmnQByTn3
```

</Details>

### Try It Out

This is it! This is the moment we've been working for.  Copy and paste this command to echo to the screen the url to 
test out and let's see ZAC protected by BrowZer!!!

```text
echo " "
echo "now go to: https://${ZITI_BROWZER_VHOST}:${ZITI_BROWZER_BOOTSTRAPPER_LISTEN_PORT} and see your ${ZITI_BROWZER_SERVICE}!"
echo " "
```

### If Needed, BrowZer Bootstrapper Logs

```text
journalctl -fu browzer-bootstrapper
```

## BrowZer UI Controls & White Labeling

By default, BrowZer renders some things in the browser-client that you may wish to change, or disable. 

These items include:
- whether or not the browZer button appears
- the logo in the browZer button if it is present
- whether or not the bootstrapping splash text appears
- the text of the bootstrapping splash text if it is present
- whether or not the the browZer toast messages appear
- whether or not the the browZer throughput chart appears

You can control all this by using the `ZITI_BROWZER_WHITELABEL` env var. 

For example:

```text
export ZITI_BROWZER_WHITELABEL="$(cat <<HERE
{
    "enable": {
        "browZerButton":            false,
        "browZerToastMessages":     true,
        "browZerSplashScreen":      true,
        "browZerThroughputChart":   false
    },
    "branding": {
        "browZerName":              "WebCloak",
        "browZerSplashMessage":     "Hang Tight while we Bootstrap your private web app",
        "browZerButtonIconSvgUrl":  "https://netfoundry.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/netfoundry-icon-color.svg",
        "browZerCSS":               "https://<YOUR_BOOTSTRAPPER_HOST>/ziti-browzer-css.css"
    }
}
HERE
)"
```

Where:

`enable.browZerButton` is either `true` or `false`

`enable.browZerToastMessages` is either `true` or `false`

`enable.browZerSplashScreen` is either `true` or `false`

`enable.browZerThroughputChart` is either `true` or `false`

`branding.browZerName` is an arbitrary name you chose.

`branding.browZerSplashMessage` is arbitrary text you chose.

`branding.browZerButtonIconSvgUrl` is the URL of the logo SVG you want rendered inside the browZer button.

`branding.browZerCSS` must be specified, but cannot be set to an arbitrary URL at this time.


## Cleaning up and Trying Again

To clean everything up and try it all over (if you need to) run these commands:
```text
sudo systemctl stop browzer-bootstrapper
sudo systemctl stop ziti-controller 
sudo systemctl stop ziti-router
sudo rm -rf $HOME/.ziti/quickstart
unsetZitiEnv
cd 
```
