## Overview of a Ziti Network

The Ziti Network (Ziti) is composed of the following building
blocks: Ziti Controller, Ziti Router, Ziti Edge Router, Ziti Edge Clients. These
components are used in conjunction to provide secure
connectivity between two points such as a client to a server. This
type of network is considered an overlay network because it
provides secure connectivity on top – or “overlaying” – existing
networking infrastructure.
