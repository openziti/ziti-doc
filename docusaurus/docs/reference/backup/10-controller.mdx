## Backup

You can recover from the catastrophic loss of the controller if you back up the configuration file, root CA, and
database.

The three stateful aspects of the controller are the configuration file, PKI, and the database. Ensure you back up all
the files mentioned in the controller's configuration file (keys, certs, root CA bundle, and the database), and the
config YAML file itself.

If you're using the Linux service you may accomplish this by triggering the database snapshot operation and backing up
the `/var/lib/ziti-controller` directory.

### Backing up the Configuration File

The controller's configuration file is specified as a positional parameter when the controller is run. You can back
up this file or provide any valid controller configuration file to recover.

### Backing up the PKI Files

It is crucial to back up the irreplaceable root CAs. You can ease disaster recovery by issuing all leaf certificates
from an intermediate CA and securing the root CA on a different host. This ensures that the controller's PKI files are
replaceable. You can safely remove the root CA from the controller host after it is secured elsewhere, or you can begin
with the root CA on a different host and issue an intermediate CA for the first controller and any future replacement
controllers.

The controller issues leaf certificates during enrollment from its edge signer CA. If the edge signer is an
intermediate, then it's unnecessary to back up the intermediate CA cert or private key because every part of the system
is configured to trust the root. The controller's leaf certificate files must begin with the leaf and contain their
intermediate issuer chain. This configures the controller to present the partial chain during the TLS handshake,
allowing the other party to complete the chain with their copy of the root CA.

The following configuration properties refer to PKI files that must be backed up if not using an intermediate CA.

-   `identity` may appear in several places and always configures keys, leaf certs, and CA certs. When this property
    appears at the top level of the configuration file, its `ca` property has a special meaning and configures a bundle of
    root CAs that all parts of the network should trust.
-   `edge.enrollment.signingCert` always appears in one place and configures the controller's edge signer CA key and cert.

### Backing up the Database

The Controller uses a [Bolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) database to store its state. You will use the database
snapshot to initialize the replacement controller during recovery.

The database is a writeable file in a path specified by the controller's configuration property `db` ([link to config
reference](/reference/30-configuration/controller.md#db)).

Use the controller's built-in database snapshot operation to preserve data integrity. The snapshot operation creates a
snapshot file in the same filesystem directory as the main database file on the controller host, so you can periodically
back up the directory containing the configuration file and database and snapshots.

## Recovery

In a scenario where the controller's state was lost, you can recover by restoring the configuration file, PKI, and
database snapshot.

### Recovering Configuration File

The path to the configuration file is a controller run parameter. You can restore the same configuration file or
provide any valid controller configuration. It's not necessary to use the same filesystem paths on the new host, but the
configuration file must be edited to reflect the new paths if they change. You may use environment variables within the
configuration file for paths within the `db` and any `identity` blocks.

### Recovering PKI

The controller's configuration file contains URIs for its private keys, leaf certificates, edge signer CA
certificate, and trust bundle. If the URI scheme is not specified it is interpreted as a `file://` URI, which may be
relative to the directory where the configuration file is located or absolute.

You can restore these files from a backup, or, if using intermediate CA(s), you can instead generate new keys, issue a
new intermediate CA cert from the same root CA, and issue new leaf certificates from the new intermediate CA ([link to certificate renewal guide](/guides/troubleshooting/pki-troubleshooting/renew-cert.md)).

## Recovering the Database

If the controller was lost then a new controller can be initialized with a database snapshot.

If you backed up the directory containing the active database and snapshots, ensure you restore the latest snapshot to
preserve data integrity. The backed-up active database file may not be internally consistent.
