## Steps

1. Create and validate your certificates (for example with Let's Encrypt Certbot)
1. Alter the controller configuration using example below as a guide
1. Restart the `ziti-controller` service

See the example configuration here:

```yaml
web:
  - name: client-management
    identity:
      ...
      alt_server_certs:
      - server_cert: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/fullchain.pem"
        server_key:  "/etc/letsencrypt/live/<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/privkey.pem"
```
At this point, the controller service should use the certificates for the ZAC, removing any "Potential Security
Risk" warnings.
