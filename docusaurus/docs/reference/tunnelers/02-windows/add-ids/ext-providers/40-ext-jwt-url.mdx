# By URL

<AboutExtAuth />

Adding an identity by URL is very straight-forward. Deliver the root URL of the OpenZiti controller to the user, and
send them the following instructions.

## Prerequisites
* OpenZiti Controller 1.2+
* ZDEW 2.5.2+
* an `external-jwt-provider` is properly configured
* an identity exists with an `external-id` field set to a value provided from the external provider
* the OpenZiti Controller is configured to serve a pre-configured trusted certificate. The certificate must be verifiable
  by the OS without additional information such as using a widely trusted CA or the Windows administrator has
  added the certificate chain to the OS trust store

## Adding the Identity

To add an identity to Windows by URL, first start by clicking on the "ADD IDENTITY" button in the top right of the screen.
After the context menu pops up, select the "With URL" option.
