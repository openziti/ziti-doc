<ExtAuthNew />

## Prerequisites
* OpenZiti Controller 1.2+
* ZDEW 2.5.2+
* an `external-jwt-provider` is properly configured
* an identity exists with an `external-id` field set to a value provided from the external provider
* the OpenZiti network operator has sent the Windows machine the network jwt file

### Obtain the Network JWT - ZAC

Adding an identity to a Windows machine that uses an external provider as the primary authentication mechanism with a JWT
requires the user or an operator to obtain a JWT ahead of time. This can be done in two different ways.

Obtain a controller's network JWT using the Ziti Admin Console. From the Authentication->JWT Signers page, click on 
"Download Network JWT" located on the top right, near the "plus" icon.

### Obtain the Network JWT - Shell

Alternatively, a request can be made to the OpenZiti controller's API to return the JWT. Make an HTTP GET to the controller's
`/network-jwts` endpoint and extract the `token` field and save this content to a JWT. Using bash, `curl` and `jq` this
might look something like:
```text
curl -s https://my.openziti.controller.local:443/network-jwts | jq -r .data[].token > my-network-jwt
```
</Details>

## Adding the Identity

With the JWT on the Windows machine to be added, click on the "ADD IDENTITY" button in the top right of the screen. 
After the context menu pops up choose "With JWT". In the file dialog, select the network JWT file and the identity will
be added to the system.
