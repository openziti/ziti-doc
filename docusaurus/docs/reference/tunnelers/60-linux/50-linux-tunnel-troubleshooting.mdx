# Troubleshooting

## DNS Not Working

<LinuxResolverConfig/>

## Increase Log Level

Set the log level to DEBUG to identify the activity that is occurring at the same time as the problem.

```text
# set the logLevel to "debug" in /opt/openziti/etc/ziti-edge-tunnel/config.json
sudo -u ziti ziti-edge-tunnel set_log_level --loglevel DEBUG
```

## Capture the Current Process Log

```text
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID=$(systemctl show -p InvocationID --value ziti-edge-tunnel.service) -l \
| tee /tmp/ziti-edge-tunnel.log
```

## Systemd Service Won't Start or Keeps Restarting

Reload the systemd service unit definitions to rule out a stale definition.

```text
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Inspect the service unit.

```text
sudo systemctl cat ziti-edge-tunnel.service
```

Check the service status for events.

```text
sudo systemctl status ziti-edge-tunnel.service
```

Monitor the service logs.

```text
sudo journalctl -u ziti-edge-tunnel.service
```

Edit the service unit.

```text
sudo systemctl edit ziti-edge-tunnel.service
```

## Intercepting or Hosting Not Working

Inspect the identity and router info for a running tunneler process. This creates a file named like `{{identity name}}.ziti`
for each loaded identity. Each file summarizes the available services and router connections for the identity.

```text
sudo -u ziti ziti-edge-tunnel dump -p /tmp/ziti-dump-dir/
```

Find tunneler's nameserver IP.

```text
$ resolvectl --interface=ziti0 dns
Link 19 (tun0): 100.64.0.2
```

Query the Ziti nameserver to find the intercept IP address for a service.

```text
dig +noall +answer my.ziti.service.example.com @100.64.0.2
```

```buttonless title="Output"
my.ziti.service.example.com. 60 IN    A       100.64.0.3
```

The tunneler provides end-to-end TCP handshake. Test the service's ability to accept connections even if it does not
provide a greeting or banner as shown in the OpenSSH server example below.

```text
# wait up to 3 seconds for a TCP handshake on port 443
$ ncat -vzw3 100.64.0.3 443
Ncat: Connected to 100.64.0.3:443.
Ncat: 0 bytes sent, 0 bytes received in 0.08 seconds.
```

```text
# wait up to 3 seconds for an OpenSSH server greeting on port 22
$ ncat -vw3 100.64.0.3 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4
```

## Process Keeps Crashing

A crash may be caused by a segmentation fault. If saving a Corefile is enabled, Linux will create a core dump file
according to this pattern file: `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`. Ubuntu configures this to use
[Apport](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport). Read more about [core dumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump).

Please raise [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/openziti/ziti-tunnel-sdk-c/issues/) if the tunneler crashes.

## Operation Not Permitted

Deleting the `/tmp/.ziti` directory and restarting the tunneler may solve this issue if the tunneler was previously run as root.

```text
WARN ziti-edge-tunnel:ziti-edge-tunnel.c:1686 make_socket_path() failed to set ownership of /tmp/.ziti to 1003:1003: Operation not permitted (errno=1)
WARN ziti-edge-tunnel:ziti-edge-tunnel.c:1730 run_tunneler_loop() One or more socket servers did not properly start.
```

Another symptom of the same issue is this error when attempting to send a message to the IPC socket server, which is not running.

```text
failed to connect: -111/connection refused
```

<!-- uncomment when ZET warns about non-writable identity directory
## Identity Directory not Writable

The tunneler will warn if the identity directory is not writable by the run-as user because it needs to manage identity files, e.g., to renew certificates.

Correct the filemode and owner.

```text
sudo chown -cR :ziti        /opt/openziti/etc/identities
sudo chmod -cR ug=rwX,o-rwx /opt/openziti/etc/identities
```
