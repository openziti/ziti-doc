The tunneller can run with zero or more identities loaded, and needs at least one to make OpenZiti services available on
the host. Adding an identity means providing a JWT enrollment token which is used by the tunneller to obtain a client
certificate from the OpenZiti controller. [Learn more about OpenZiti Identities](../../../learn/core-concepts/identities/overview.mdx).

### Add a Single Identity

Root and members of group `ziti` may add an identity without restarting. 

```text
sudo ziti-edge-tunnel add --jwt "$(< ./in-file.jwt)" --identity myIdentityName
```

[Learn more about enrolling](../../../learn/core-concepts/identities/20-enrolling.md).

### Load Identities Directory

The tunneller will load all enrolled identities in the `--identity-dir` directory at startup. The default location for
identities is is `/opt/openziti/etc/identities`. Add enrolled identity files to this directory by copying the JSON file
into the directory and setting permissions for group `ziti`.

:::note
Linux package users may place enrollment tokens named `*.jwt` in this directory for automatic enrollment at next
startup.
:::

Ensure the identities directory and its contents are writable by group `ziti` to allow the tunneler to manage identities, e.g., renew certificates, and not readable by others to protect the confidentiality of the identities.

```text
sudo chown -cR :ziti        /opt/openziti/etc/identities
sudo chmod -cR ug=rwX,o-rwx /opt/openziti/etc/identities
```

The tunneller process needs to be restarted if the contents of `/opt/openziti/etc/identities` change.

```text
# package users can restart with systemd
sudo systemctl restart ziti-edge-tunnel.service
```
