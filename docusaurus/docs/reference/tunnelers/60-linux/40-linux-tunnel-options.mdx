# Options and Modes

## `ziti-edge-tunnel` Environment Variables

`ZITI_TIME_FORMAT=utc` - set the log message time format to UTC timestamp instead of milliseconds since start

`ZITI_LOG=4` - set the log level of the underlying Ziti C SDK, higher is more verbose (level 4 means DEBUG)

`TLSUV_DEBUG=4` - set the log level of the underlying libuv library, higher is more verbose (level 4 means DEBUG)

For more information about configuring the underlying Ziti C SDK with environment variables, see [the Ziti C SDK documentation](/reference/developer/sdk/ziti-sdk-c.mdx).

## `ziti-edge-tunnel` Global Options

You can start `ziti-edge-tunnel` with different options, some of the most commonly used options are listed below.

```text
# Load a single identity.
--identity <identity>
```

```text
# Load all identities in a dir, ignoring files with a .bak or .original filename suffix.
--identity-dir <dir>
```

```text
# Set log level, higher is more verbose (default level 3 means INFO).
--verbose N
```

```text
# Set service polling interval in seconds (default 10).
--refresh N
```

## Run Modes

There are two run modes:

* `run`: transparent proxy with DNS nameserver
* `run-host`: hosting-only without proxy or nameserver

### `run` Mode

`ziti-edge-tunnel run` provides a transparent proxy and nameserver. The nameserver may be configured to be authoritative (the default) or recursive with command-line option `--dns-upstream`. `systemd-resolved`, if enabled, automatically configures the Ziti nameserver. You may inspect the configuration with these commands.

```text
resolvectl dns     # inspect the association of tun device and nameserver
resolvectl domain  # inspect the configuration of query routing domains
```

If any interface has a wildcard routing domain configured, `ziti-edge-tunnel` will also configure its tun with a wildcard routing domain. If no other interface has a wildcard routing domain configured, neither will the `ziti-edge-tunnel` tun.

```text
# Specify the tun interface address and the subnet to which Service domain names are resolved (default 100.64.0.1/10). The nameserver address is always the tun interface address +1, default is 100.64.0.2.
--dns-ip-range <ip range>
```

#### How does `run` configure nameservers?

<LinuxResolverConfig/>

#### System Requirements for Mode `run`

`ziti-edge-tunnel run` requires Linux capabilities for managing the `/dev/net/tun` device, running `resolvectl` to assign nameservers and domain routes to the tun interface, and running `ip route` to manage IP routes.

* tun device and route management are permitted by passing the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` to the ziti-edge-tunnel process via `AmbientCapabilities` in the systemd service unit.
* `systemd-resolved` DNS configuration is permitted by a PolKit rule installed with the RPM or DEB package.

### `run-host` Mode

`ziti-edge-tunnel run-host` is a mode for hosting (listening) for services which does provide service intercepts or DNS. Services configured for 'Bind' will be hosted by the tunneler.

#### System Requirements for Mode `run-host`

`ziti-edge-tunnel run-host` does not require elevated privileges or the above device or socket, only network egress to the servers for which it is hosting Services.
