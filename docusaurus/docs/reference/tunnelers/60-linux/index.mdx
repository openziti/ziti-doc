:::important
Persistent, writable volumes are necessary for the tunneler to manage identity files, e.g., certificate renewal.
:::

The purpose of the tunneller is to configure host access. This means all users and all processes on the host will share
the same level of access. This is accomplished by configuring the OS to have an OpenZiti DNS nameserver and IP routes
for authorized services.

## Install Linux Package

Reasons to use the package:

1. Install the tunneller as a systemd service.
1. Create permissions and policies for the tunneller to run as a non-root user.
1. Enroll the identity and clean up the enrollment token in identity directory.
1. Upgrade the tunneller when a new package is available.

Linux DEB packages are currently available for the x86_64 and arm64 platforms and RPM packages are available for x86_64.
ARM/v7 (32bit) binaries are available from GitHub.
