[The latest stable release](https://github.com/openziti/ziti-tunnel-sdk-c/releases/latest/) of `ziti-edge-tunnel` is
distributed as an executable binary in GitHub.


1. Unzip the downloaded file and copy the binary to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`.

    ```text
    sudo install -o root -g root ./ziti-edge-tunnel /usr/local/bin/
    ```

1. Create a POSIX group named `ziti` if it doesn't already exist. Members of this group can access the identity files and send IPC commands to the socket server.

    ```text
    sudo groupadd --system ziti
    ```

1. Create a directory to hold the identity files. The tunneler will manage the contents of the identity directory.

    ```text
    sudo mkdir -pv /opt/openziti/etc/identities
    ```

1. Run the Manually Installed Binary

    When not using the Linux package, you must run the tunneler as root so it will have permission to manage IP routes and the resolver configuration.

    ```text
    sudo ziti-edge-tunnel run --identity-dir /opt/openziti/etc/identities
    ```

1. Add an Identity

    <LinuxAddIdentities/>

1. Configure the Resolver

    <LinuxResolverConfig/>
