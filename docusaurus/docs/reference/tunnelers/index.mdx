title: Tunnelers
---

Each tunneler operates similarly. The goal is to have the tunneler seamlessly intercept traffic destined for Ziti
services and forward that traffic over the Ziti overlay instead of the [underlay](../../reference/glossary.mdx#underlay) network. All processes on the host can access the Ziti services available to the tunneler's loaded identities.

A tunneler configures a Ziti nameserver for resolving Ziti service addresses and associated Ziti IP routes in a device's OS. These are quickly updated when a policy change alters the visible Ziti services for any loaded Ziti identity.
