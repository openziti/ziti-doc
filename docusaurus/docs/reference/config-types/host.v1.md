# The `host.v1` Config Type

The `host.v1` configuration type defines how edge routers or tunnelers can make outgoing connections
for associated services. The config type also allows specifying health checks for the service. An
endpoint in a `host.v1` config can be specified explicitly or can be configured to use information
passed through from a tunneler intercepting traffic, allowing it to forward traffic.

The `host.v1` type only allows defining a single host endpoint. If multiple endpoints are required,
use the [`host.v2`](./host.v2.md) config type instead.

## Endpoint Configuration

For services with defined endpoints, the following three attributes are required:

* `address` - an IP or DNS address to connect to
* `port` - the network port to connect to
* `protocol` - tcp or udp

**Examples**

This service is hosted by one application server.

```text
{
  "address": "192.168.100.1",
  "port": 80,
  "protocol": "tcp"
}
```

## Forwarding Configuration

Services that are forwarding traffic from an OpenZiti tunneling proxy may use the following
properties to indicate what should be forwarded:

* `forwardProtocol` - flag indicating that the protocol of the intercepted connection is to be used.
  Can only be set to true.
* `allowedProtocols` - the list of allowed protocols. Valid values include `tcp` and `udp`
* `forwardAddress` - flag indicating that the target address of the intercepted connection is to be
  used. Can only be set to true.
* `forwardAddressTranslations` - the list of translations that specify which address to connect
  to for a given target address. See [below example](#forward-all-address-components-with-ip-translation)
* `allowedAddresses` - the list of allowed addresses. Valid values include IPs, hostnames and CIDRs
* `forwardPort` - flag indicating that the target port of the intercepted connection is to be used.
  Can only be set to true.
* `allowedPortRanges` - the list of allowed port ranges.
    * Example: `allowedPortRanges: [ {"low" : 80, "high" : 80}, {"low" : 8080, "high" : 8090} ]`
* `allowedSourceAddresses` - list of allowed addresses in IP, hostname or CIDR
    * hosting tunnelers establish local routes for the specified source addresses so binding will
      succeed

**Examples**

#### Forward All Address Components, with IP Translation
```text
{
  "forwardAddress": true,
  "forwardAddressTranslations": [
     { "from": "192.168.1.0", "to": "172.16.4.0", "prefixLength": 24 },
     { "from": "10.0.0.0", "to": "10.10.0.0", "prefixLength": 16 }
  ],
  "allowedAddresses": [
    "192.168.1.0/24",
    "10.0.0.1/16"
  ],
  "forwardPort": true,
  "allowedPortRanges": [
    {
      "low": "1024",
      "high": 2048
    }
  ],
  "forwardProtocol": true,
  "allowedProtocols": [
    "tcp",
    "udp"
  ]
}
```

This example "forwards" all components (protocol, host, port) of the address that was intercepted by
by the client tunneler. Additionally, the destination IP address is translated as specified by
`forwardAddressTranslations`. The hosting tunneler will make the following connections when using
this example configuration:

| target/intercepted address | final connection destination |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| tcp:192.168.1.8:1032       | tcp:172.16.4.8:1032          |
| tcp:10.0.2.32:1500         | tcp:10.10.2.32:1500          |
--------------------------------------------------------------

A target address is only translated if it matches the "from" value of an address translation. If no
translations have a matching "from" address (or no translations are specified) then the hosting
tunneler will use the target address that was intercepted by the client tunneler.

Note that not everything must be forwarded. For example the address is not forwarded in the example
below. The port and protocol are forwarded and the corresponding 'allow' is set, but the address is
statically set to '192.168.100.1

#### Forward Destination Port
```text
{
  "address": "192.168.100.1",
  "forwardPort": true,
  "allowedPortRanges": [
    {
      "low": "1024",
      "high": 2048
    }
  ],
  "forwardProtocol": true,
  "allowedProtocols": [
    "tcp",
    "udp"
  ]
}
```

Health checks and listen options also can be specified for the endpoint.

* `listenOptions` - Provides ways to customize the hosting endpoint
    * See the [full definition below](#listen-options)
* `portChecks` - TCP port health check definitions
    * See the [full definition below](#port-checks)
* `httpChecks` - HTTP health check definitions
    * See the [full definition below](#http-checks)

## Listen Options

* `bindUsingEdgeIdentity` - Associate the hosting endpoint with the name of the hosting tunneler's
  identity. Setting this to 'true' is equivalent to setting 'identity=$tunneler_id.name'",
    * Boolean value, defaults to `false`
* `connectTimeout` - Timeout when making connections to the external server. Specified as a
  duration. Examples: `500ms`, `5s`, `1m`. Defaults to `5s`.
* `connectTimeoutSeconds` - Same as `connectTimeout` but specified as the number of seconds using a
  positive integer. If both `connectTimeout` and `connectTimeoutSeconds` are specified, then
  `connectTimeout` will be used. Defaults to 5. This option will be deprecated in favor of
  `connectTimeout` in the future.
* `cost` - Static cost of the endpoint. Must be a value between 0 and 65535. Default to 0.
* `identity` - Associate the hosting endpoint with the specified identity.
    * '$tunneler_id.name' resolves to the name of the hosting tunneler's identity.
    * '$tunneler_id.tag[tagName]' resolves to the value of the 'tagName' tag on the hosting
      tunneler's identity.
* `maxConnections` - Number of routers to create endpoints on. Does not apply to hosting edge
  routers, only to SDK hosted tunnelers.
* `precedence` - Initial precedence. Must be one of `default`, `required` or `failed`. Defaults
  to `default`.

**Example**

```text
{
  "address": "192.168.100.1",
  "port": 80,
  "protocol": "tcp",
  "listenOptions": {
    "connectTimeout": "1s",
    "cost": 200,
    "precedence": "required"
  }
}
```

## Health Checks

There are two kinds of health checks supported, port check and http checks.

### Port Checks

Port checks verify if a given port is accepting TCP connections. The check does not attempt to send
or receive any data. Port check definitions support the following properties:

* `address` - an IP or DNS address with port.
    * This field is required.
    * Example: `192.168.1.100:8080`
    * Example: `myserver.com:8080`
* `interval` - how often to run the health check.
    * This field is required.
    * Example: `5s` (5 seconds)
    * Example: `1m` (1 minute)
    * Example: `250ms` (250 milliseconds)
* `timeout` - the connection timeout. Uses same format as interval.
    * This field is required.
    * Example: `10s` (10 seconds)
* `actions` - how to react to health check result. Covered in more detail below.

### HTTP Checks

HTTP checks make a call to an HTTP endpoint, which may include submitting a static body and checking
the check results. HTTP check definitions support the following properties:

* `url` - the URL to connect to.
    * This field is required.
* `method` - the method to use. Valid values include `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`.
    * This field is optional and defaults to `GET`.
* `body` - the data to submit in the body of the HTTP request.
    * This field is optional and defaults to an empty string.
* `expectStatus` - the response status code to expect. The check will fail if a different status
  code is encountered.
    * This field is optional and defaults to `200`.
* `expectInBody` - a string to expect in the status code response. The check will fail if the string
  is not found.
    * This field is optional. If not specified, the response body will not be checked.
* `interval` - how often to run the health check.
    * This field is required.
    * Example: `5s` (5 seconds)
    * Example: `1m` (1 minute)
    * Example: `250ms` (250 milliseconds)
* `timeout` - the connection timeout. Uses same format as interval.
    * This field is required.
    * Example: `10s` (10 seconds)
* `actions` - how to react to health check result. Covered in more detail below.

### Actions

Actions define how health checks results should be reacted to. Each check may have multiple actions.
Actions support the following properties:

* `trigger` - which kind of health check result to react to. Valid values include `pass`, `fail`
  and `change`.
    * This field is required
    * `change` is when the status changes from `pass` to `fail` or from `fail` to `pass`.
* `duration` - only trigger the action if the trigger state has existed for the given duration.
    * This field is optional. If not specified, the duration is not checked.
    * Example: `30s` (30 seconds)
    * Use with `change` trigger events is not recommended.
* `consecutiveEvents` - the number of consecutive results of the given trigger type before executing
  the action.
    * This field is optional and defaults to 1
    * Use with `change` trigger events is not recommended.
* `action` - the action to take when the conditions defined by `trigger`, `duration`
  and `consecutiveEvents` are met.
    * This field is required
    * Valid actions include:
        * `mark unhealthy` - sets the precedence to `failed`.
        * `mark healthy` - sets the precedence back from `failed` to its original value.
        * `increase cost N` - increases the cost by `N`.
        * `decrease cost N` - decreases the cost by `N`.
        * `send event` - causes an event to be emitted from the controller. Useful for alerting or
          external integrations.

:::note

Although multiple health checks can be configured, it's best if the actions don't overlap. If
multiple health checks change the health status, the behavior when one check is passing and another
is failing is undefined. It should generally be safe to have multiple checks adjusting cost or
generating events.

:::

**Port Check Example**

This config will cause a port check to run against the service every five seconds. After the check
has failed twice in a row, the endpoint will be marked failed. After the check has been passing for
a minute, the endpoint will be restored to its original precedence.
