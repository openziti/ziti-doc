The OpenZiti Admin Console (ZAC) is a web UI provided by the OpenZiti project for administration and observability.

Deploying the console involves two steps.

1. Deploy the console's static files, i.e., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.
2. Configure the controller to serve the console's static files from the management API web binding.
