## Recover

Routers are replaceable without a backup. You can use role attributes in your policies or
re-enroll an unavailable router.

### Role Attributes

You can recover without a backup by creating a new router with the same roles. Policies that authorize routers with role
attributes (e.g., `#some-role`), not mentions (e.g., `@router1`) will authorize a replacement router with the same roles
with the same privileges.

Remember to delete the replaced router.

### Re-enrollment

You can recover without a backup by re-enrolling an existing router. Re-enrolling a router will invalidate the existing
enrollment and existing policy grants for the router's ID (e.g., `@router1`) will still be valid.

Re-enroll with the CLI like this.

```text
ziti edge re-enroll edge-router router1 --jwt-output-file /tmp/router1.jwt
```

```buttonless title="Expected output"
re-enroll edge-router with id XVXqEG6ANz: OK
Enrollment expires at 2024-04-19T18:12:47.489Z
```

### Restore Files

If you have a backup of the router's identity files, you can restore them to a new host. The router's identity files are
the only state that must be restored. You probably also want to restore the configuration file, but you may use any
valid router configuration. 

The necessary files are referred to in the configuration file as filesystem paths in `identity`
blocks, of which there are one or more. If you restore the identity files to a new location, you must edit the
configuration file to reflect the new paths or use environment variables within the configuration file for
paths within the `identity` block.

## Backup

The router has two stateful elements: the configuration file and the identity files mentioned in the configuration
file. The router will cache control plane information in the same directory as the configuration file, but it's not
essential to back it up as long as the configuration file points to a valid control plane endpoint.

### Identity Files

The router's identity files (keys and certs) uniquely identify the router to the controller. To recover a unique router
identity you must back up the files mentioned in the following configuration properties:

- `identity` may appear in several places and always configures keys and certs for the router

### Configuration File

The router's configuration file is specified as a positional parameter when the router is run. You can edit the
file to change the filesystem path for any files that are restored to a new location.
