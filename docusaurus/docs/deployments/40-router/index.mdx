## Requirements

Each router must have a unique identity and configuration YAML file.

## The Router's Identity Certificates

Each router is issued a client and server certificate from a controller's edge enrollment signer intermediate CA. In the configuration YAML file, [the property `identity`](/reference/30-configuration/conventions.md) configures the router's identity certificate and private key.

## The Configuration YAML File

[The configuration YAML file](/reference/30-configuration/router.md) is required for all routers. It is used to configure the router's identity, controller endpoints file, listener addresses, and more.

A utility or template is provided for each type of deployment to assist with generating a valid configuration YAML file.
